A  pervasive example is open source software (OSS), a global public good that plays a vital role in the economy and is foundational for most technology we use today. However, it is difficult to measure the value of OSS due to its non-pecuniary nature and lack of centralized usage tracking. Therefore, OSS remains largely unaccounted for in economic measures. Although prior studies have estimate...&quot;,&quot;## 1. Introduction\\\\n\\\\nIn 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that &amp;#x27;software is eating the world&amp;#x27; (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that &amp;#x27;open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,&amp;#x27; (Jacks, 2022). Other recent studies have come to similar conclusions showing that open source software  (OSS)  -  software  whose  source  code  is  publicly  available  for  inspection,  us...&quot;,&quot;## 2. Empirical Setting and Data\\\\n\\\\nAlthough the concept of free and open software has existed since the 1950&amp;#x27;s, it became more popular in the 1980&amp;#x27;s due to the efforts of Richard Stallman and his launch of the GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation (Maracke, 2019). However, it was in the 1990&amp;#x27;s that OSS took off after Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel, a now widely adopted OSS operating system (Tozzi, 2016). Today, OSS is considered a key building block of the digital economy and is ...&quot;,&quot;## 3. Methodology\\\\n\\\\nWe first measure the value of OSS by considering the supply and the demand side of OSS using a labor market approach. 14 The thought experiment is that we live in a world where OSS does not exist and has to be recreated at each firm that uses a given piece of OSS. Using the labor market approach, we calculate the labor replacement cost of each OSS package. To estimate the value for each package, we use COCOMO II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) at the individual package level...&quot;,&quot;## 3.1 Labor market approach\\\\n\\\\nFor the labor market approach, we estimate the value of OSS by calculating the replacement value of a package. We ask how much it would cost to reproduce the package by hiring a programmer and paying them a competitive market wage. To estimate this supply-side value ( \\\\ud835\\\\udc49 ! \\\\&quot;#$%&amp;amp;amp; ) , we take the complete list of OSS packages discussed above, and then count the lines of code in each unique\\\\n\\\\n14 In an alternative version, we use a mixture of a labor and goods market ...&quot;,&quot;## 3.2 Contribution Measurement\\\\n\\\\nTo better understand how value is created and whether it is created equally or unequally, we build up a graphical depiction in three steps. In the first step, we measure the value contributions by developers. In a second step, we obtain a measure for the number of repositories developers contribute to. Finally, we provide a graphical representation of both using the commonly known concept of the Lorenz curve to better understand the extent of inequality in contri...&quot;,&quot;## 4. Results\\\\n\\\\nAfter applying the labor market approach using COCOMO II, we obtain global estimates for the value of OSS. To calculate the overall value, we first need the underlying number of lines of code (to calculate the supply-side value) and then the usage statistics (for the demand-side value). Since there may be substantial heterogeneity in value by programming languages, we also show the top programming languages during our investigation period in the year 2020, as discussed above.&quot;,&quot;## --- Table 1 about here ---\\\\n\\\\nTable  1  shows  descriptive  statistics  from  both  data  sets  separately.  The  inward-facing Census  (Panel  A)  contains  just  over  261.7  million  lines  of  code  with  72%  of  the  lines  being attributable to the top programming languages. The average package includes 142 thousand lines of code with a slightly lower average of 113 thousand lines of code for the subset of top languages. When considering the demand (usage) side, we observe that the Censu...&quot;,&quot;## --- Figure 1 about here ---\\\\n\\\\nFigure 1 shows the heterogeneity of the value of OSS across the top programming languages. Panel A shows the supply side value with the labor value being displayed on the vertical axis. We find that OSS packages created in Go have the highest value with $803 million in value that would have to be created from scratch if the OSS packages did not exist. Go is closely followed by JavaScript  and  Java  with  $758  million  and  $658  million,  respectively.  The  val...&quot;,&quot;## --- Figure 2 about here ---\\\\n\\\\nFigure 2 splits the OSS value estimates for each language by our inward facing (Census) and outward facing (BuiltWith) data sources. Panel A and Panel B focus on the supply and demand side estimation for the Census. We obtain a similar pattern that has been established already in the aggregate when pooling both data sources (Figure 1) albeit the impact of JavaScript is substantially lower.  On  the  supply  side  of  the  Census  in  Panel  A,  Java  has  the  sec...&quot;,&quot;## -- Figure 4 about here ---\\\\n\\\\nFigure 3 shows the Lorenz curves and the number of repositories that a fraction of programmers has contributed to for the supply side (Panel A) and the demand side (Panel B). A Lorenz curve that  lay  directly  on  the  45  degree  line  would  imply  a  very  even  distribution  of  values  across programmers. Instead, Panel A shows a Lorenz curve as a nearly flat line with a drastic increase for the final share of programmers. This implies that the distribution o...&quot;,&quot;## 5. Conclusion\\\\n\\\\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith. We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average valu...&quot;,&quot;## References\\\\n\\\\nAlmeida, D. A., Murphy, G. C., Wilson, G., &amp;amp;amp; Hoye, M.

We identify several OSS packages that have similar closed-source, pecuniary alternatives and consider the costs if all commercial users of the free OSS had to replace that software with a pecuniary alternative (similar to the calculations Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) performed for web servers).

This is achieved by:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Counting Lines of Code**: Each unique OSS package&amp;#x27;s lines of code are counted.\\\\n2. **Using COCOMO II**: The Constructive Cost Model II (COCOMO II) is used to convert these lines of code into dollar values. This model includes non-linear adjustment factors and effort-adjustment parameters to estimate the effort required in person-month units for each project.\\\\n3. **Applying Global Wage Rates**: The estimated effort is then multiplied by a weighted global wage, which is based on the base monthly salaries of software developers in the top 30 countries by GitHub developer counts.\\\\n\\\\nThis methodology assumes no production externalities, meaning there is no spillover knowledge from one package to another that would reduce programming costs.&quot;,&quot;The authors of \\\\&quot;The Value of Open Source Software\\\\&quot; are not explicitly mentioned in the available information.&quot;,&quot;Under the high wage scenario, the labor-market value of open source using languages in different buckets is as follows:\\\\n\\\\n- **Bucket 1**: $6.22 billion for labor supply and $13.18 trillion for labor demand.\\\\n- **Bucket 2**: $6.26 billion for labor supply and $13.24 trillion for labor demand.\\\\n- **Bucket 3**: $9.59 billion for labor supply and $17.91 trillion for labor demand.&quot;,&quot;The two main data sources used to estimate the value of open source software in the Harvard Business School&amp;#x27;s OSS report are:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries**: This project aggregates data from multiple software composition analysis firms to track widely used OSS in company codebases.\\\\n\\\\n2. **BuiltWith dataset**: This dataset provides scans of nearly nine million websites to identify the underlying technology, including OSS libraries, used by these websites.\\\\n\\\\nThese datasets complement each other by focusing on different aspects of OSS usage, reducing the chances of double-counting.&quot;,&quot;Panel A of Figure 3 indicates a highly uneven distribution of supply value among programmers. The Lorenz curve shown is almost flat with a sharp increase for the last share of programmers, revealing that the final five percent of programmers account for over 93% of the supply side value. This highlights a concentration of supply value among a small number of programmers.&quot;,&quot;The Linux Foundation provided financial and administrative support for the working paper.&quot;,&quot;The study estimates the demand-side value of open source software to be $8.8 trillion, with some variance depending on whether programmers from low- or high-income countries are considered.&quot;,&quot;The goods-market valuation approach for estimating the value of Open Source Software (OSS) involves identifying proprietary software equivalents for OSS packages and considering the costs if all commercial users of the free OSS had to replace it with these paid alternatives. This method assumes a scenario where OSS does not exist and must be recreated by a single firm, which then sells it at a price. A basket of equivalent proprietary goods is created to represent the diversity of OSS, and prices for these proprietary equivalents are obtained. The approach uses these prices to estimate the goods-market value of OSS, which is generally lower than the labor market value because the firm can sell the software multiple times at a fixed price. This method requires several assumptions and is considered a complement to the labor cost approach, which is emphasized more due to data limitations and the complexities involved in the goods-market approach.&quot;,&quot;The estimated demand-side value of widely-used open source software globally is $8.8 trillion.&quot;,&quot;Some examples of mark-up languages listed in Bucket 1 of the OSS report are BIBTEX, HTML, XML, and MARKDOWN.&quot;,&quot;The estimated demand-side value of open source software (OSS) globally, utilizing programmers from across the world, is approximately $8.8 trillion.&quot;,&quot;The Harvard Business School&amp;#x27;s report uses a labor market approach to estimate the value of open source software (OSS). This involves calculating the labor replacement cost of each OSS package using the COCOMO II model at the individual package level. The supply-side labor market replacement value is determined by summing the values of all packages. This value is then adjusted based on the number of times firms use each package, while removing multi-usage within each firm, to derive a demand-side value. The methodology also examines inequality in the value creation process by analyzing individual developer contributions using GHTorrent data, focusing on both OSS value contributions and the total number of repositories contributed to.&quot;,&quot;The authors of \\\\&quot;The Value of Open Source Software\\\\&quot; are not explicitly mentioned in the available information.&quot;,&quot;According to the BuiltWith dataset, JavaScript has the highest demand-side value.&quot;,&quot;The template engines listed in Panel B: Bucket 2 - Auxiliary Languages are Cheetah, Genshi, Pug, Smarty, and Velocity.&quot;,&quot;The authors of the Harvard Business School&amp;#x27;s report titled \\\\&quot;The Value of Open Source Software\\\\&quot; are M. Hoffmann, F. Nagle, and Y. Zhou.&quot;,&quot;The identifier of the working paper mentioned is 24-038.&quot;,&quot;The two main data sources used to estimate the value of open source software (OSS) in the study are:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Labor Market Approach using COCOMO II**: This approach estimates the value of OSS by assessing the labor required to develop the software using the COCOMO II model.\\\\n\\\\n2. **GHTorrent Data**: This dataset provides a comprehensive view of the development activities on GitHub, which is a major platform for OSS projects.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, other research studies use:\\\\n\\\\n- **Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries**: This project aggregates data from multiple software composition analysis firms to track OSS usage across numerous firms.\\\\n- **BuiltWith Dataset**: This dataset scans nearly nine million websites to identify the underlying technology, including OSS libraries, used by these websites.&quot;,&quot;The methodology used in the Harvard Business School&amp;#x27;s report to estimate the value of Open Source Software (OSS) involves a labor market approach. This approach includes:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Supply Side**: Calculating the labor replacement cost of each OSS package using the COCOMO II model at the individual package level. These values are then summed to obtain a total supply-side labor market replacement value.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Demand Side**: Scaling the supply-side value by the number of times firms use each package, while accounting for multi-usage within each firm.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Inequality in Value Creation**: Analyzing individual developer contributions using GHTorrent data to understand the concentration of contributions among developers. This involves examining both the value contributions and the number of repositories contributed to.&quot;,&quot;The configuration languages mentioned in Panel B: Bucket 2, distinct from formatting or template engines, include:\\\\n\\\\n- CMAKE\\\\n- INI\\\\n- MAKEFILE\\\\n- NGINX CONFIGURATION FILE\\\\n- NSIS\\\\n- SQUIDCONF\\\\n- TERRAFORM\\\\n- TOML&quot;,&quot;If firms were required to independently recreate all open-source software packages they currently utilize:\\\\n\\\\n- Using labor from a low wage country, the financial burden would be approximately $2.59 trillion.\\\\n- Using labor from a high wage country, the estimated financial burden would be $13.18 trillion.&quot;,&quot;According to the Harvard Business School&amp;#x27;s OSS report, the estimated financial worth of open source software, considering both supply and demand factors, is as follows:\\\\n\\\\n- **Supply-side value**: The cost to recreate the most widely used open source software is estimated at $4.15 billion.\\\\n- **Demand-side value**: The replacement value for firms using the software is much larger, estimated at $8.8 trillion.\\\\n\\\\nThis highlights the significant financial impact and value of open source software to companies worldwide.&quot;,&quot;The goods-market valuation approach for OSS, as discussed in the Harvard Business School report, involves several constraints and assumptions:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Database Limitations**: There is no readily available database for proprietary equivalents of OSS, which requires a subjective search for popular OSS and their closed-source substitutes.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Fixed Pricing Assumption**: The approach assumes a fixed price for selling a good multiple times, which is generally lower than the total value estimated from recreating all packages on the labor side.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Data Limitations**: Due to data limitations, substantial assumptions are necessary, complicating accurate value estimation.\\\\n\\\\n4. **Market Demand Sensitivity**: The pricing strategy of proprietary software is sensitive to market demand. The approach assumes that the market demands for the basket software and OSS are similar, leading to comparable prices.\\\\n\\\\n5. **Complexity with Multiple Goods**: Extending the goods-market approach to multiple goods introduces more complexity and assumptions compared to focusing on a single type of software. \\\\n\\\\nThese constraints and assumptions highlight the challenges in accurately estimating the value of OSS when using proprietary equivalents as substitutes.&quot;,&quot;The Mark-Up Languages listed under &amp;#x27;Bucket 1&amp;#x27; in the Online Appendix are:\\\\n\\\\n- **BIBTEX**: Used for formatting lists of references in LaTeX documents.\\\\n- **COLDFUSION HTML**: A markup language used in Adobe ColdFusion for web development.\\\\n- **DOCBOOK XML**: A semantic markup language for technical documentation.\\\\n- **HAML**: A templating system used in Ruby for clean and readable HTML generation.\\\\n- **HTML**: The standard markup language for creating web pages.\\\\n- **HXML**: A variant of XML used for data representation.\\\\n- **JAVAEE XML**: Used in Java EE for configuration and deployment descriptors.\\\\n- **MARKDOWN**: A lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.\\\\n- **MASON**: A Perl-based web templating system.\\\\n- **MXML**: Used in Adobe Flex for user interface design.\\\\n- **RELAX-NG COMPACT**: A schema language for XML.\\\\n- **RHTML**: Embedded Ruby in HTML, used in Ruby on Rails.\\\\n- **TEX**: A typesetting system used for document preparation.\\\\n- **XML**: A markup language for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.\\\\n- **XQUERY**: A query and functional programming language used to query XML data.\\\\n- **YAML**: A human-readable data serialization standard.\\\\n\\\\nThese languages are primarily used for structuring, presenting, and managing data in a readable format. They differ from programming languages in that they are not typically used for creating algorithms or performing computations. Instead, they focus on the organization and display of information, often in web development, document formatting, and data interchange. For example, HTML is used for creating web pages, XML is used for data representation, and MARKDOWN is used for formatting text in a simple and readable way.&quot;,&quot;The organizations that offered both financial and administrative backing for the working paper authored by Manuel Hoffmann, Frank Nagle, and Yanuo Zhou are the Linux Foundation and Harvard Business School.&quot;,&quot;The estimated demand-side value of widely-used open source software, according to the study using data from the Census of OSS and BuiltWith datasets, is $8.8 trillion. This value reflects the cost for companies to rewrite the software they use, highlighting the substantial economic impact of open source software.\\\\n\\\\nIn comparison, the supply-side value focuses on the cost it would take to rewrite each piece of widely-used open source software. While specific figures for the supply-side value are not detailed, the study emphasizes that the demand-side value is significant and likely an underestimate of the true value due to the challenges in identifying all open source software used worldwide.&quot;,&quot;The estimated labor-market value of open source projects utilizing programming languages in bucket 1 is between $2.59 trillion and $13.18 trillion, depending on whether labor from a low-wage or high-wage country is used. Using a global pool of programmers, the cost is approximately $8.80 trillion. However, the OSS report does not provide specific estimates for the labor-market value of open source projects utilizing programming languages in buckets 2 and 3. The estimates mentioned are primarily based on software languages classified in bucket 1.&quot;,&quot;According to the Harvard Business School&amp;#x27;s OSS report, the estimated value of the demand-side benefits generated by widely-used open source software is $8.8 trillion. In comparison, the supply-side costs of recreating the software are estimated at $4.15 billion. This means that the demand-side benefits are significantly larger, indicating that firms would need to spend 3.5 times more on software than they currently do if open source software did not exist.&quot;,&quot;The document \\\\&quot;The Value of Open Source Software\\\\&quot; does not explicitly mention its authors or specify their contributions or roles.&quot;,&quot;The estimated demand-side value of open-source software globally is $8.8 trillion. However, this value varies significantly when considering the origin of the programmers. If we only use programmers from high-income countries, the demand-side value is estimated at $13.18 trillion. This suggests that the economic contribution of open-source software is greater when the analysis is based on the higher wages typical of high-income countries, compared to a diverse international workforce.&quot;,&quot;The estimated demand-side value of open source software worldwide is $8.8 trillion, considering the varying income levels of programmers from diverse international backgrounds.&quot;,&quot;The authors of the report titled &amp;#x27;The Value of Open Source Software&amp;#x27; are not explicitly mentioned in the available information, so specific names, affiliations, or contributions cannot be identified.&quot;,&quot;The Lorenz curve is applied in the OSS report to visually analyze the spread of developer contribution values by arranging developers in ascending order based on their contributions to both demand and supply sides. These contributions are normalized to a scale from 0 to 100 percentiles, which are used as the x-axis values for the Lorenz curves. The y-axis represents the corresponding value contributions. This helps to understand the degree of inequality in value contributions among developers, indicating how concentrated or dispersed these contributions are within the OSS ecosystem.&quot;,&quot;The Harvard Business School study on the valuation of open source software utilizes two primary data sources:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries**: This source captures OSS usage by aggregating data from multiple software composition analysis firms, focusing on OSS built into the software that companies sell.\\\\n\\\\n2. **BuiltWith dataset**: This dataset provides insights into the technology used by nearly nine million websites, focusing on OSS integrated into company websites.\\\\n\\\\nThese sources aim to capture a comprehensive view of OSS usage across firms globally, reducing the likelihood of double-counting and focusing on widely deployed OSS.&quot;,&quot;The Harvard Business School&amp;#x27;s report employs a labor market approach to calculate the supply-side value of Open Source Software (OSS) in a hypothetical scenario where OSS needs to be recreated from scratch. It uses the COCOMO II model at the individual package level to estimate the labor replacement cost for each OSS package. The values of all packages are then summed to obtain a supply-side labor market replacement value. This approach assumes that in a world without OSS, each firm would need to recreate the software it uses, and the cost to do so is calculated using this model.&quot;,&quot;The Harvard Business School&amp;#x27;s OSS report utilizes the COCOMO II model to calculate the supply-side value of Open Source Software. This methodology involves estimating the labor replacement cost of each OSS package individually, and then summing the values of all packages to obtain a total supply-side labor market replacement value.&quot;,&quot;Could you please provide the context or details about the working paper you are referring to?&quot;,&quot;The top programming languages used in widely-adopted open source software are Go, JavaScript, Java, C, Python, and Typescript.\\\\n\\\\nTo recreate all such software using exclusively U.S.-based programmers, the financial requirement is estimated to be $6.22 billion. In contrast, using a global pool of programmers would require approximately $8.80 trillion. This indicates that utilizing U.S.-based programmers is significantly more cost-effective compared to employing a global pool.&quot;,&quot;The Lorenz curve analysis for supply value concentration among programmers indicates a highly uneven distribution. The curve is nearly flat with a sharp increase towards the end, showing that the supply value is much more concentrated than the typical 80/20 rule. Specifically, the top 5% of programmers are responsible for generating over 93% of the supply side value. This means that a small group of programmers is creating the majority of the open-source software (OSS) code used by firms. These top contributors are not only focusing on a few high-value repositories but are contributing to a large number of repositories, highlighting their significant role in the OSS ecosystem.&quot;,&quot;The estimated cost to reproduce all widely-used open-source software (OSS) using programmers exclusively from a high-income country, such as the United States, is $6.22 billion.&quot;,&quot;The estimated demand-side value of widely-used open-source software (OSS) globally is $8.8 trillion, with over 95% of this value being generated by just five percent of programmers.&quot;,&quot;The Harvard Business School&amp;#x27;s OSS report employs the labor market approach to estimate the value of open-source software by calculating the replacement cost of each OSS package. This involves:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Counting Lines of Code**: The methodology starts by counting the lines of code in each unique OSS package.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Using COCOMO II**: The Constructive Cost Model II (COCOMO II) is used to convert these lines of code into dollar values, which represent the cost to reproduce the package by hiring a programmer at a competitive market wage.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Supply-Side Value**: The supply-side value is obtained by summing the values of all OSS packages.\\\\n\\\\n4. **Demand-Side Value**: This is calculated by scaling the supply-side value based on the number of times firms use each package, ensuring no multi-usage within each firm.\\\\n\\\\n5. **Global Wage Data**: The approach uses global wage data to estimate costs, with variations based on different labor markets.\\\\n\\\\nThis methodology does not account for production or consumption externalities.&quot;,&quot;The estimated demand-side value of open source software (OSS) globally, considering contributions from programmers worldwide, is $8.8 trillion.&quot;,&quot;In Working Paper 24-038, the value of Open Source Software (OSS) is estimated using the labor market approach by calculating the replacement value of each OSS package. This involves determining the cost to reproduce the package by hiring a programmer at a competitive market wage. The process includes:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Counting Lines of Code**: The number of lines of code in each unique OSS package is counted.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Applying COCOMO II Model**: The Constructive Cost Model II (COCOMO II) is used to convert these lines of code into dollar values. This model allows for non-linear transformations and adjusts for effort and other factors. It has been used by the U.S. Department of Defense and in prior research.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Global Wage Calculation**: The results from the COCOMO II model are multiplied by a weighted global wage to estimate the price of each OSS project. This global wage is based on the base monthly salaries of software developers from the top 30 countries by GitHub developer counts, weighted by each country&amp;#x27;s share of active contributors.\\\\n\\\\n4. **Variation Consideration**: The approach also considers variations in value by using low-wage and high-wage labor markets to understand how the value would change with different pools of programmers.\\\\n\\\\nThis method provides a comprehensive estimate of the value of OSS by considering both the technical and economic aspects of software development.&quot;,&quot;The authors of &amp;#x27;The Value of Open Source Software&amp;#x27; report are not explicitly mentioned in the available information.&quot;,&quot;I couldn&amp;#x27;t find specific information about the authors of \\\\&quot;The Value of Open Source Software\\\\&quot; report. You might want to check the report itself or the organization that published it for author details.&quot;,&quot;In 2020, examples of configuration languages from Panel B: Bucket 2 - Auxiliary Languages included CMAKE, NGINX CONFIGURATION FILE, and TERRAFORM.&quot;,&quot;The estimated demand-side value of widely-used open source software (OSS) globally, if firms had to recreate all OSS packages they use, involves calculating the cost for each firm to pay a developer to rewrite those packages. This is done by:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Scaling the Supply-Side Labor Market Replacement Value**: This involves determining the cost of labor required to recreate the OSS packages, considering the number of times firms use each package, while removing multi-usage within each firm.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Using COCOMO II**: The Constructive Cost Model II (COCOMO II) is used to determine the dollar-value for each package.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Multiplying by a Weighted Global Wage**: The dollar-value is then multiplied by a weighted global wage for programmers. This global wage is calculated from the base monthly salaries of software developers in the top 30 countries by GitHub developer counts, weighted by each country&amp;#x27;s share of active GitHub contributors.\\\\n\\\\nThis approach provides a comprehensive estimate of the demand-side value of OSS by considering the cost implications of recreating these packages using global labor resources.&quot;,&quot;The study uses two primary data sources to estimate the value of open source software (OSS): \\\\n\\\\n1. **Census of OSS**: This is inward facing and identifies OSS code used in products created by firms.\\\\n2. **BuiltWith data**: This is outward facing and identifies OSS code that consumers interact with through firm websites.&quot;,&quot;The top 30 countries for global wage analysis in the context of open source software include the United States, China, Germany, India, and the United Kingdom, among others. These countries represent 88% of GitHub activity from 2020, highlighting their major role in open source software development.&quot;,&quot;The working paper authored by Manuel Hoffmann, Frank Nagle, and Yanuo Zhou received financial and administrative backing from the Linux Foundation, which was essential for accessing data from the Census. Additionally, funding for the research was provided in part by Harvard Business School.&quot;,&quot;The identifier for the working paper related to Lorenz curves and the distribution of value among programmers is not available in the provided information.&quot;,&quot;The authors of \\\\&quot;The Value of Open Source Software\\\\&quot; are Nagle, F., Dana, J., Hoffman, J., Randazzo, S., and Zhou, Y.&quot;,&quot;The two principal data sources used in the Harvard Business School&amp;#x27;s OSS report to estimate the value of open source software are the \\\\&quot;Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries\\\\&quot; and the BuiltWith dataset.&quot;,&quot;The Harvard Business School&amp;#x27;s OSS report describes the goods-market valuation approach for estimating the value of open-source software (OSS) as a method that assesses the cost of replacing OSS with proprietary alternatives. This approach considers a scenario where OSS does not exist, and a firm must recreate it and sell it at a price. It uses a basket of proprietary software equivalents to represent OSS, obtaining prices for these substitutes to estimate the goods replacement value. This method assumes a fixed price for selling the software multiple times, which typically results in a lower valuation compared to the labor replacement cost method. The goods-market approach is more complex due to data limitations and requires assumptions about market demand and pricing strategies. Despite these challenges, it provides an alternative perspective on the value of OSS, although it is considered to potentially underestimate the value compared to the labor cost approach.\\\\n\\\\nRegarding the software languages classified in bucket 1 from Table A1, these are the languages most likely to be human-written, including programming and markup languages.&quot;,&quot;The primary data sources used to evaluate the value of open source software in both broad and deep aspects are:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries**: This source provides insights into OSS usage at tens of thousands of firms globally.\\\\n\\\\n2. **BuiltWith dataset**: This dataset helps in understanding the technology deployed by nearly nine million websites.\\\\n\\\\nThese sources collectively allow for a comprehensive measurement of OSS usage across various firms and websites.&quot;,&quot;To estimate the value of open-source software (OSS) without considering production externalities, two primary methodologies are employed:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Labor Replacement Cost Approach**: This method calculates the cost to recreate the software by estimating the labor required to develop it from scratch. It focuses on the supply-side value by considering the expenses a firm would incur to build the software internally if OSS did not exist.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Goods Replacement Value Approach**: This method involves identifying proprietary alternatives to OSS and estimating the cost if users had to replace the free software with these paid alternatives. It considers the demand-side value by evaluating the price firms would pay for proprietary software that serves a similar function to the OSS.\\\\n\\\\nBoth approaches aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the economic value of OSS by considering different aspects of its usage and replacement costs.&quot;,&quot;Examples of mark-up languages from Bucket 1, which are most likely to be written by a human, include HTML, Markdown, and XML.&quot;,&quot;Panel A of Figure 3 reveals that the distribution of supply value among programmers is highly concentrated, significantly more so than the 80/20 standard. The Lorenz curve shown is almost flat with a sharp increase at the end, indicating that the last five percent of programmers are responsible for generating over 93% of the supply side value. This highlights a much higher concentration of value creation among a small group of programmers compared to the typical 80/20 distribution.&quot;,&quot;According to the Harvard Business School&amp;#x27;s OSS report, the estimated global demand-side value of widely-used open source software is $8.8 trillion.&quot;,&quot;The two primary data sources used in the Harvard Business School&amp;#x27;s OSS report to estimate the value of widely-used open source software are the \\\\&quot;Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries\\\\&quot; and the BuiltWith dataset.&quot;,&quot;The Harvard Business School&amp;#x27;s OSS report estimates the global demand-side value of open source software at $8.8 trillion. This figure represents the replacement cost for firms worldwide if they had to internally build the software that open source currently provides.&quot;,&quot;The authors of \\\\&quot;The Value of Open Source Software\\\\&quot; are not explicitly listed in the available information. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!&quot;,&quot;The goods-market valuation approach for open-source software (OSS), as described in the Harvard Business School&amp;#x27;s OSS report, estimates the value of OSS by considering the cost of replacing it with proprietary, closed-source alternatives. Here&amp;#x27;s how it works:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Substitute Basket Creation**: This method involves creating a basket of proprietary software that can serve as substitutes for various OSS packages. These substitutes cover a wide range of software types, such as media and design tools, statistical analysis software, and web servers.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Price Estimation**: Prices for these proprietary equivalents are obtained. This involves determining what it would cost to purchase these proprietary alternatives if OSS did not exist.\\\\n\\\\n3. **COCOMO Labor Market Supply-Side Value**: The COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model) labor market supply-side value is calculated for each OSS product in the basket. This value acts as a proxy for the cost of developing the proprietary software from scratch.\\\\n\\\\n4. **Demand-Side Value Consideration**: The approach also considers the demand-side value by estimating the price a firm would charge if it produced and sold all existing widely used OSS.\\\\n\\\\n5. **Comparison with Labor Replacement Cost Method**: Unlike the labor replacement cost method, which estimates the cost of recreating OSS based on labor, the goods-market approach assumes a fixed price for selling the software multiple times. This price is typically lower than the total value estimated from recreating all packages on the labor side.\\\\n\\\\n6. **Underestimation Acknowledgment**: Due to data limitations and the need for numerous assumptions, this method is seen as a substantial underestimate of OSS value compared to the labor cost approach.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, the goods-market approach provides an alternative perspective on valuing OSS by focusing on market-based pricing of proprietary substitutes, despite its complexities and potential underestimation.&quot;,&quot;The Lorenz curve is the method used to graphically examine the dispersion of developer contribution values in open-source software projects. It is a tool for representing inequality and helps in understanding the distribution of contributions among developers.&quot;,&quot;The countries included in the top 30 for global wage analysis according to the OSS report are:\\\\n\\\\n1.

Austria&quot;,&quot;The identifier for the Harvard Business School&amp;#x27;s OSS report working paper is Working Paper 24-038.&quot;,&quot;The estimated cost to reproduce all widely-used open source software using programmers from the United States is approximately $6.22 billion.&quot;,&quot;The two primary data sources used in the Harvard Business School&amp;#x27;s OSS report to estimate the value of open source software are the \\\\&quot;Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries\\\\&quot; and the BuiltWith dataset.&quot;,&quot;I&amp;#x27;m sorry, but I couldn&amp;#x27;t find specific information about the mark-up languages listed in Bucket 1 of the Harvard Business School OSS report. You might want to check the report directly for detailed information.&quot;,&quot;The two main data sources used in the Harvard Business School&amp;#x27;s OSS report to estimate the value of open source software are the \\\\&quot;Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries\\\\&quot; and the BuiltWith dataset.&quot;,&quot;The estimated cost to recreate all widely-used open-source software using programmers from a high-income country like the United States is approximately $6.22 billion.&quot;,&quot;The methodology used in the Harvard OSS report to estimate the value of open-source software (OSS) using the labor market approach involves calculating the labor replacement cost of each OSS package. Here&amp;#x27;s how it&amp;#x27;s done:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Supply-Side Value**: The report uses the Constructive Cost Model II (COCOMO II) to estimate the cost of reproducing each OSS package. This involves counting the lines of code in each unique package and converting these into dollar values, based on the cost of hiring a programmer at a competitive market wage.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Demand-Side Value**: This is calculated by scaling the supply-side value according to the number of times firms use each package. The methodology ensures that multiple usages within each firm are not double-counted.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Global Wage Data**: The estimation uses global wage data to determine the cost of recreating OSS packages.\\\\n\\\\nThis approach focuses on the labor replacement cost and does not account for production or consumption externalities.&quot;,&quot;The Harvard Business School&amp;#x27;s OSS report estimates the supply-side value of open-source software (OSS) using labor market replacement costs by following these steps:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Counting Lines of Code**: They start by counting the lines of code in each unique OSS package.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Using COCOMO II Model**: The Constructive Cost Model II (COCOMO II) is used to convert these lines of code into dollar values. This model helps estimate the cost of reproducing the software by hiring programmers.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Calculating Labor Replacement Cost**: The value of each OSS package is calculated based on how much it would cost to hire a programmer to reproduce the package, paying them a competitive market wage.\\\\n\\\\n4. **Summing Individual Values**: The individual values of all OSS packages are summed to obtain the total supply-side labor market replacement value.\\\\n\\\\n5. **Assumptions**: The method assumes no production externalities, meaning it does not account for any spillover knowledge that might reduce programming costs.\\\\n\\\\n6. **Global Wage Calculation**: A global wage is calculated from the base monthly salaries of software developers in the top 30 countries by GitHub developer counts, which is used in the cost estimation.\\\\n\\\\nThis approach provides an estimate of the economic value of OSS by considering what it would cost to replace the software through traditional labor markets.&quot;,&quot;The template engines listed in Panel B: Bucket 2 - Auxiliary Languages in the OSS report are Cheetah, Genshi, Pug, Smarty, and Velocity.&quot;,&quot;The Harvard Business School&amp;#x27;s OSS report estimates the supply-side value of Open Source Software (OSS) by calculating the labor replacement cost of each OSS package using a labor market approach. This involves employing the COCOMO II model at the individual package level and then summing the values across all packages to obtain a supply-side labor market replacement value.&quot;,&quot;The Harvard Business School report titled \\\\&quot;The Value of Open Source Software\\\\&quot; was authored by Frank Nagle. The report provides a detailed analysis of the value of open source software (OSS) by examining both the cost to create it (supply-side) and its usage (demand-side). It estimates the demand-side value of OSS to be between $2.59 trillion and $13.18 trillion, highlighting its significant role in the economy.\\\\n\\\\nThe report emphasizes the importance of OSS to businesses and the broader economy, suggesting that users should contribute to its maintenance to ensure the health of the OSS ecosystem. It also points out the need for societal support for OSS, as a small number of contributors are responsible for creating the majority of its value.&quot;,&quot;The working paper authored by Manuel Hoffmann, Frank Nagle, and Yanuo Zhou was supported by the following organizations:\\\\n\\\\n- The Linux Foundation\\\\n- Harvard Business School\\\\n- Research Computing Services at Harvard Business School\\\\n- The Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard\\\\n- Software composition analysis data providers: Snyk, the Synopsys Cybersecurity Research Center, and FOSSA.&quot;,&quot;The Lorenz curve in Panel A of Figure 3 reveals a highly uneven distribution of supply value among programmers in open-source software. It shows that a small percentage of programmers, particularly the last five percent, are responsible for generating over 93% of the supply side value. This indicates a significant concentration of supply value among a few programmers, far exceeding the typical 80/20 distribution standard.&quot;,&quot;The Harvard Business School&amp;#x27;s OSS report uses two main data sources to estimate the value of open source software: the \\\\&quot;Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries\\\\&quot; and the BuiltWith dataset. The Census II project aggregates data from multiple software composition analysis firms to track OSS usage at numerous firms, while the BuiltWith dataset provides scans of nearly nine million websites to identify the underlying technology, including OSS libraries. These datasets focus on different aspects of OSS usage, helping to reduce the chances of double-counting.\\\\n\\\\nTo estimate the demand-side value of open source software, the report calculates the replacement value for each firm using the software. This involves determining the cost for each firm to internally build the software if open source software did not exist. By using data from these two primary sources, the report captures OSS usage by millions of global firms, allowing for a comprehensive estimation of the demand-side value, which is estimated at $8.8 trillion, significantly larger than the supply-side value.&quot;,&quot;The authors of the Harvard Business School working paper titled &amp;#x27;Working Paper 24-038&amp;#x27; are Manuel Hoffmann, Frank Nagle, and Yanuo Zhou. The organizations that provided support for the data used in this paper include the Linux Foundation, Snyk, the Synopsys Cybersecurity Research Center, and FOSSA.&quot;,&quot;The report titled &amp;#x27;The Value of Open Source Software&amp;#x27; does not have specific authors or a publication date mentioned in the available context. If you have access to the report, you might find this information in the document itself, typically in the introduction or at the end.&quot;,&quot;The Lorenz curve in Panel A of Figure 3 indicates that the distribution of supply value among programmers is highly uneven and concentrated. A small percentage of programmers, specifically the last five percent, generate over 93% of the supply side value, highlighting a significant concentration of supply value among a very small number of programmers.\\\\n\\\\nIn comparison, the demand side value distribution is even more concentrated than the supply side. The last five percent of programmers generate over 96% of the demand side value, indicating a higher level of inequality in the distribution of demand side value among programmers.&quot;,&quot;According to the Harvard Business School&amp;#x27;s OSS report, the valuation of Open Source Software (OSS) can be approached through two main methods: the goods-market valuation approach and the labor market valuation approach.\\\\n\\\\n1. **Goods-Market Valuation Approach**:\\\\n   - This approach estimates the value of OSS by considering the costs if all commercial users of free OSS had to replace it with proprietary, closed-source alternatives.\\\\n   - It involves creating a basket of proprietary software that serves as substitutes for OSS and using the prices of these proprietary equivalents to estimate the value of OSS.\\\\n   - The method assumes a fixed price for selling a good multiple times, which is typically lower than the total value estimated from recreating all packages on the labor side.\\\\n   - It provides a demand-side value by considering the price a firm would charge if it produced all existing widely used OSS and sold it as a product.\\\\n   - This approach results in a substantially smaller value compared to the labor demand value, as it assumes the software is produced once and sold to many customers.\\\\n   - The approach involves several assumptions and data limitations, making it a more complex and potentially underestimated valuation method compared to the labor cost approach.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Labor Market Valuation Approach**:\\\\n   - This approach calculates the replacement cost of each OSS package by determining how much it would cost to reproduce the package using a programmer paid at a competitive market wage.\\\\n   - It uses the Constructive Cost Model II (COCOMO II) to estimate the supply-side value by counting the lines of code in each unique package and converting these into dollar values.\\\\n   - The demand-side value is calculated by scaling the supply-side value based on the number of times firms use each package, ensuring that multi-usage within each firm is removed.\\\\n   - This method does not account for production or consumption externalities, meaning it assumes no spillover knowledge or public benefit from the creation of OSS packages.\\\\n   - The approach also considers global wage variations by using data from the top 30 countries with the most GitHub contributors.&quot;,&quot;The study uses two primary data sources to estimate the value of open source software (OSS):\\\\n\\\\n1. **Census II of Free and Open Source Software**: This focuses on OSS usage within products created by firms.\\\\n2. **BuiltWith dataset**: This scans public websites to identify the technologies they use, including OSS libraries.\\\\n\\\\nTo estimate the labor replacement value of OSS, the study calculates how much it would cost to reproduce each OSS package by hiring a programmer and paying them a competitive market wage. This involves:\\\\n\\\\n- Counting the lines of code in each unique package.\\\\n- Using the Constructive Cost Model II (COCOMO II) to transform these lines of code into dollar values, incorporating non-linear adjustment factors and effort-adjustment parameters.\\\\n- Summing the values of all packages to obtain the total value.\\\\n- Considering the global wage of programmers by using base monthly salaries from the top 30 countries with the most GitHub contributors, weighted by each country&amp;#x27;s share of active contributors.\\\\n\\\\nThis approach provides a supply-side labor market replacement value for OSS.&quot;,&quot;The Harvard Business School&amp;#x27;s OSS report measures the value of open source software (OSS) using two approaches: the labor market approach and the goods-market valuation approach.\\\\n\\\\n1. **Labor Market Approach**: This method calculates the labor replacement cost of each OSS package. It estimates how much it would cost to reproduce the package by hiring a programmer and paying them a competitive market wage. The Constructive Cost Model II (COCOMO II) is used to estimate the supply-side value by counting the lines of code in each unique package and converting these into dollar values. The demand-side value is then calculated by scaling the supply-side value based on the number of times firms use each package, while ensuring that multi-usage within each firm is removed. This approach provides a comprehensive view of the value of OSS by considering both the cost to recreate the software and its usage across firms.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Goods-Market Valuation Approach**: This method estimates the value of OSS by considering the cost of replacing it with proprietary alternatives. It assumes a scenario where OSS does not exist and must be recreated by a single firm, which then sells it at a price. The approach involves creating a basket of proprietary software that serves as substitutes for OSS, obtaining prices for these proprietary equivalents, and calculating the average price and labor supply-side value for the basket. This method typically results in a lower valuation because it assumes a fixed price for selling the software multiple times. The goods-market approach also considers the demand-side value by estimating the price a firm would charge if it produced and sold all existing widely used OSS. However, due to data limitations and assumptions required, the report places more emphasis on the labor cost approach.&quot;,&quot;According to Figure 1, the programming language with the highest value on the supply side is Go, with a value of $803 million. The estimated cost to recreate all widely-used open-source software (OSS) using programmers from the United States is $6.22 billion.&quot;,&quot;The working paper number and identifier associated with the Harvard Business School&amp;#x27;s OSS report is Working Paper 24-038.&quot;,&quot;The two main data sources used to estimate the value of open source software in the Harvard Business School&amp;#x27;s OSS report are the \\\\&quot;Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries\\\\&quot; and the BuiltWith dataset.\\\\n\\\\nTo address the potential issue of double-counting, the report removes multi-usage within each firm when scaling the supply-side value by the number of times firms are using each OSS package. This ensures that the demand-side value accurately reflects the unique usage of each package without inflating the value through repeated counts within the same firm.&quot;,&quot;In the OSS report, the value contribution of a developer to a repository is calculated by determining the developer&amp;#x27;s share of commits relative to the total number of commits for that repository. This share is then multiplied by the repository&amp;#x27;s demand and supply values separately to derive the value-added contribution of the individual developer to the repository. These value contributions are then aggregated across all repositories for each developer.\\\\n\\\\nLorenz curves are used in the analysis of developer contributions to graphically examine the dispersion of contribution values among developers. They help represent inequality, allowing for a better understanding of how developer contributions to open-source software (OSS) are distributed in terms of demand and supply values. This analysis helps identify whether the value generated is concentrated within a small number of developers or more evenly distributed across many contributors.&quot;,&quot;JavaScript holds significant value in the BuiltWith dataset as it is the primary driver of supply-side value and also leads in demand-side value, with TypeScript following as the second most valuable language. This aligns with their main use cases, particularly in web programming.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to the Harvard Business School&amp;#x27;s OSS report, the \\\\&quot;Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services\\\\&quot; industry receives the highest demand-side value from open source software, with a usage value of around $43 billion.&quot;,&quot;The Harvard Business School&amp;#x27;s OSS report identifies several challenges in measuring the value of open source software (OSS):\\\\n\\\\n1. **Non-Pecuniary Nature**: OSS is typically available for free, making traditional economic valuation methods, which rely on price and quantity, inapplicable.\\\\n2. **Lack of Centralized Tracking**: There is no centralized system to track OSS usage, complicating the measurement of its value.\\\\n3. **Demand-Side Valuation**: Estimating the demand-side value is difficult due to the absence of data on how widely OSS is used across different firms.\\\\n4. **Supply-Side Estimation**: Efforts to estimate the supply-side costs of recreating OSS often assume all OSS is equally valuable and do not account for its extensive usage across multiple firms, leading to an incomplete picture of its true economic and social value.\\\\n\\\\nThe report makes several key contributions to academic literature and policy makers:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Novel Methodology**: It introduces a labor market approach to calculate the labor replacement cost of OSS packages, providing a quantifiable measure of OSS value from both supply and demand perspectives.\\\\n2. **Inequality in Value Creation**: The report highlights the inequality in value creation within OSS communities, where a small number of contributors often provide the majority of contributions. This insight can inform policy makers about the dynamics of OSS development and the potential need for policies supporting equitable contribution and recognition.\\\\n3. **Concentration of Contributions**: The findings on the concentration of contributions could influence how organizations and communities structure their support and incentives for OSS development.&quot;,&quot;The report on the value of Open Source Software was authored by Nagle, F., Dana, J., Hoffman, J., Randazzo, S., and Zhou, Y., and it was released in 2022.&quot;,&quot;The estimated cost to reproduce all widely-used open-source software (OSS) varies depending on the income level of the countries from which programmers are sourced. Using programmers from a low-income country like India, the cost would be approximately $1.22 billion. If using programmers from a high-income country like the United States, the cost would be around $6.22 billion. A more balanced approach, using a global pool of programmers with wages weighted based on existing geographic contributions to OSS, would result in a cost of about $4.15 billion.\\\\n\\\\nIn terms of demand-side value, OSS provides significant economic benefits compared to global software revenue and private-sector investment in software. It is estimated that firms would need to spend 3.5 times more on software than they currently do if OSS did not exist. This underscores the substantial economic impact and cost savings that OSS contributes to the global economy.&quot;,&quot;Examples of configuration languages include:\\\\n\\\\n- CMAKE\\\\n- INI\\\\n- MAKEFILE\\\\n- NGINX CONFIGURATION FILE\\\\n- NSIS\\\\n- SQUIDCONF\\\\n- TERRAFORM\\\\n- TOML\\\\n\\\\nTemplate engines mentioned are:\\\\n\\\\n- Cheetah\\\\n- Genshi\\\\n- Pug\\\\n- Smarty\\\\n- Velocity&quot;,&quot;The two main data sources used to estimate the value of widely-used open source software in the Harvard Business School&amp;#x27;s OSS report are the \\\\&quot;Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries\\\\&quot; and the BuiltWith dataset.\\\\n\\\\nRegarding the demand-side value of open source software, the report finds that it is significantly larger than the supply-side value, estimated at $8.8 trillion. It highlights that firms would need to spend 3.5 times more on software if open source software did not exist. Additionally, the report notes that the top six programming languages account for 84% of this demand-side value, and 96% of the value is created by only 5% of open source software developers.&quot;,&quot;The Harvard Business School&amp;#x27;s report estimates the value of open-source software (OSS) using two approaches: the labor market approach and the goods-market valuation approach.\\\\n\\\\n1. **Labor Market Approach**: This method estimates the value of OSS by calculating the replacement cost of each OSS package. It involves determining how much it would cost to reproduce a package by hiring a programmer at a competitive market wage. The process includes counting the lines of code in each unique package and using the Constructive Cost Model II (COCOMO II) to convert these into dollar values. The supply-side value is calculated by summing the values of all packages, while the demand-side value is determined by scaling the supply-side value based on the number of times firms use each package, ensuring that multi-usage within each firm is removed. This approach focuses on the direct costs of rewriting OSS packages and does not account for production or consumption externalities.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Goods-Market Valuation Approach**: This method considers the costs that would be incurred if all commercial users of free OSS had to replace it with pecuniary, closed-source alternatives. It uses a basket of proprietary software equivalents to represent the OSS products and calculates their market prices. The approach assumes a scenario where a single firm reproduces the OSS and sells it at a fixed price, which is typically lower than the total value estimated from recreating all packages using labor costs. This results in a goods-market supply-side value and an equivalent demand-side value, which is generally smaller than the labor demand value due to the profit made by selling the software to multiple customers. Although this method provides an alternative perspective on the economic value of OSS, it is complex and requires several assumptions, leading to a substantial underestimate of the OSS value compared to the labor cost approach.&quot;,&quot;The Harvard Business School&amp;#x27;s OSS report does not provide specific information about \\\\&quot;Bucket 1\\\\&quot; or its contents, nor does it specifically list any mark-up languages.&quot;,&quot;The authors of the report on the value of open source software are Nagle, F., Dana, J., Hoffman, J., Randazzo, S., and Zhou, Y. The main topic of the report is the estimation of the value of open source software (OSS) by measuring both the supply-side costs and the demand-side usage. It aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of OSS&amp;#x27;s economic impact, highlighting its significance in the modern economy and addressing the challenges in quantifying its value.&quot;,&quot;The estimated demand-side value of widely-used open source software globally is $8.8 trillion.&quot;,&quot;The method used to estimate the supply-side value of OSS in the Harvard Business School&amp;#x27;s report involves calculating the labor replacement cost of each OSS package using the COCOMO II model. This approach considers the scenario where OSS does not exist and has to be recreated at each firm. The individual package values are calculated and then summed to obtain the overall supply-side labor market replacement value.&quot;,&quot;The two main data sources used to estimate the value of open source software (OSS) are:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Census Dataset**: This is inward facing and helps identify OSS code used in products created by firms.\\\\n2. **BuiltWith Dataset**: This is outward facing and identifies OSS code that consumers interact with through firm websites.&quot;,&quot;The estimated global demand-side value of open source software (OSS) using programmers from across the world is approximately $8.8 trillion.&quot;,&quot;The estimated labor-market values for open source in the high wage scenario are as follows:\\\\n\\\\n- **Bucket 1**: $6.22 billion.\\\\n- **Bucket 2**: $6.26 billion for labor supply and $13.24 trillion for labor demand.\\\\n- **Bucket 3**: $9.59 billion for labor supply and $17.91 trillion for labor demand.&quot;,&quot;The estimated demand-side value of widely-used open source software globally is $8.8 trillion.&quot;,&quot;The estimated cost to recreate all widely-used open-source software using programmers from a high-income country like the United States is approximately $6.22 billion.&quot;,&quot;The goods-market valuation approach for estimating the value of open-source software (OSS), as described by the Harvard Business School&amp;#x27;s OSS report, involves assessing the cost of replacing OSS with proprietary alternatives. This method considers a scenario where OSS does not exist, and a firm must recreate it and sell it as a product. Here&amp;#x27;s how it works:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Substitute Basket Creation**: Identify a basket of proprietary software that can serve as substitutes for the OSS.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Market Price Determination**: Determine the market prices for these proprietary equivalents.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Cost Comparison**: Compare these prices with the estimated labor costs of creating the proprietary software.\\\\n\\\\n4. **Supply and Demand Values**: Calculate both supply-side and demand-side values. The demand-side value reflects the price a firm would charge for the software if it were sold to customers.\\\\n\\\\nThis approach assumes a fixed price for selling the software multiple times, which typically results in a lower valuation compared to the labor replacement cost method. However, due to data limitations and assumptions required, this approach is considered less precise than the labor cost approach.&quot;,&quot;I couldn&amp;#x27;t find specific examples of mark-up languages from the OSS report&amp;#x27;s Table A1. You might want to check the report directly for detailed information.&quot;,&quot;The two main data sources used to estimate the value of OSS in the study are the labor market approach using COCOMO II and the GHTorrent data.&quot;,&quot;I&amp;#x27;m sorry, but I couldn&amp;#x27;t find specific information about the authors of \\\\&quot;The Value of Open Source Software.\\\\&quot; If you have more details about the publication, such as the publisher or the context in which it was released, I might be able to assist you further.&quot;,&quot;Could you please provide more context or details about the Harvard Business School working paper you are referring to?

To estimate the value for each package, we use COCOMO II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) at the individual package level...&quot;,&quot;## Online Appendix\\\\n\\\\nTable A1 Languages within each bucket\\\\n\\\\n| Type                                      | Language             |\\\\n|-------------------------------------------|----------------------|\\\\n| Panel A: Bucket 1 - Languages             |                      |\\\\n| Mark-Up Language                          | BIBTEX               |\\\\n| Mark-Up Language                          | COLDFUSION HTML      |\\\\n| Mark-Up Language                          | DOCBOOK XML          |\\\\n| Mark-Up Language         ...&quot;,&quot;## -- Figure 4 about here ---\\\\n\\\\nFigure 3 shows the Lorenz curves and the number of repositories that a fraction of programmers has contributed to for the supply side (Panel A) and the demand side (Panel B).

In the first step, we measure the value contributions by developers. In a second step, we obtain a measure for the number of repositories developers contribute to. Finally, we provide a graphical representation of both using the commonly known concept of the Lorenz curve to better understand the extent of inequality in contri...&quot;,&quot;## 3. Methodology\\\\n\\\\nWe first measure the value of OSS by considering the supply and the demand side of OSS using a labor market approach. 14 The thought experiment is that we live in a world where OSS does not exist and has to be recreated at each firm that uses a given piece of OSS. Using the labor market approach, we calculate the labor replacement cost of each OSS package. To estimate the value for each package, we use COCOMO II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) at the individual package level...&quot;,&quot;## The Value of Open Source Software\\\\n\\\\nManuel Hoffmann a\\\\n\\\\nFrank Nagle b\\\\n\\\\nYanuo Zhou c\\\\n\\\\nThis version: January 1, 202 4&quot;,&quot;## --- Table 1 about here ---\\\\n\\\\nTable  1  shows  descriptive  statistics  from  both  data  sets  separately.  The  inward-facing Census  (Panel  A)  contains  just  over  261.7  million  lines  of  code  with  72%  of  the  lines  being attributable to the top programming languages. The average package includes 142 thousand lines of code with a slightly lower average of 113 thousand lines of code for the subset of top languages. When considering the demand (usage) side, we observe that the Censu...&quot;,&quot;## 3.1 Labor market approach\\\\n\\\\nFor the labor market approach, we estimate the value of OSS by calculating the replacement value of a package. We ask how much it would cost to reproduce the package by hiring a programmer and paying them a competitive market wage. To estimate this supply-side value ( \\\\ud835\\\\udc49 ! \\\\&quot;#$%&amp;amp;amp; ) , we take the complete list of OSS packages discussed above, and then count the lines of code in each

       "The  value  of  a  non-pecuniary  (free)  product  is  inherently  difficult  to  assess.  A  pervasive example is open source software (OSS), a global public good that plays a vital role in the economy and is foundational for most technology we use today. However, it is difficult to measure the value of OSS due to its non-pecuniary nature and lack of centralized usage tracking. Therefore, OSS remains largely unaccounted for in economic measures. Although prior studies have estimated the supply-side costs to recreate this software, a lack of data has hampered estimating the much larger demand-side (usage) value created by OSS. Therefore, to understand the complete economic and social value of widely-used OSS, we leverage unique global data from two complementary sources capturing  OSS  usage  by  millions  of  global  firms.  We  first  estimate  the  supply-side  value  by calculating the cost to recreate the most widely used OSS once. We then calculate the demandside value based on a replacement value for each firm that uses the software and would need to build it internally if OSS did not exist. We estimate the supply-side value of widely-used OSS is $4.15 billion, but that the demand-side value is much larger at $8.8 trillion. We find that firms would need to spend 3.5 times more on software than they currently do if OSS did not exist. The top six programming languages in our sample comprise 84% of the demand-side value of OSS. Further, 96% of the demand-side value is created by only 5% of OSS developers.\n",

       "\n",
       "In 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that 'software is eating the world' (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that 'open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,' (Jacks, 2022). Other recent studies have come to similar conclusions showing that open source software  (OSS)  -  software  whose  source  code  is  publicly  available  for  inspection,  use,  and modification and is often created in a decentralized manner and distributed for free - appears in 96% of codebases (Synopsys 2023), and that some commercial software consists of up to 99.9% freely available OSS (Musseau et al., 2022). Although in its early days OSS frequently copied features from existing proprietary software, OSS today includes cutting edge technology in various fields including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, big data, and analytics.  However, despite the increasing importance of OSS to all software (and therefore to the entire economy), measuring its impact has been elusive. Traditionally, to measure the value created by a good or service,  economists  multiply  the  price  ( p )  times  the  quantity  sold  ( q ).  However,  in  OSS, p is generally zero since the source code is publicly available, and q is  unknown due to the limited number of restrictions around how the code may be copied and reused. For example, if a company downloads  a  piece  of  OSS  from  a  public  code  repository,  it  may  copy  it  thousands  of  times internally (legally) and then share it with suppliers or customers (also legally), so public download data is insufficient. Although some recent studies have sought to estimate the value of p (discussed below), data for estimating q has been unavailable or intractable for anything more than just a handful of OSS packages. Using newly collected data from multiple sources, the goal of this paper is to provide estimates for both p and q and to use those to shine light on the question: What is the value of open source software?\n",
       "\n",
       "Understanding the value of OSS is of critical importance not only due to the role it plays in the economy, but also due to it being one of the most successful and impactful modern examples of the centuries old economic concept of 'the commons' which run the risk of meeting the fate known as 'the tragedy of the commons.' This concept can trace its roots as far back as the 4 th -century BC philosopher Aristotle who wrote 'That which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care. Men pay most attention to what is their own and care less for what is common.'  (Aristotle,  1981).  William  Forster  Lloyd  (1833)  resurfaced  the  idea  in  modern economic thought by highlighting the example of shared tracts of land used for cattle grazing by\n",
       "\n",
       "multiple cattle herders who each had an incentive to overuse the shared resource. Garrett Hardin (1968)  brought  the  concept  into  the  broader  zeitgeist  when  he  wrote  an  article  discussing  the problem entitled 'The Tragedy of the Commons.' Building on this work, Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for her research highlighting paths to avoiding the tragedy of the commons through community coordination efforts that did not necessitate government enforced laws to manage and guard the commons (Ostrom 1990). The parallels between shared grazing lands and shared digital infrastructure are palpable - the availability of communal grass to feed cattle, and in turn feed people, was critical to the agrarian economy, and the ability to not have to recreate code that someone else has already written is critical to the modern economy. Further, in both contexts, despite knowing grass and code are critical inputs to the economy, measuring their actual value is difficult. And, as the renowned mathematician and physicist Lord Kelvin is believed to have said, 'If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.' And if you cannot improve and maintain it, such common goods may crumble under the weight of their own success as they are overused, but underinvested in (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021). Therefore, measuring the value OSS creates is crucial to the future health of the digital economy, and the rest of the economy that is built on top of it.\n",
       "\n",
       "Importantly, recent studies have attempted to address these measurement issues but fall short of capturing both the breadth and depth of OSS usage - a gap we seek to fill with this paper. For example, researchers have attempted to gain breadth by using novel methodologies to estimate the labor replacement value of the current corpus of OSS created in the United States at $38 billion in 2019 (Robbins et al., 2021) and that created in the European Union at €1 billion (Blind et al., 2021) by imputing the labor costs that it would have taken to rewrite existing OSS. Such efforts do a very good job at estimating what it would cost to replace all existing OSS if it disappeared tomorrow. However, the resultant estimates rely on two important assumptions. First, that all OSS is equally valuable from a usage standpoint, and second that the concept of OSS would still exist, and society would just need to rewrite the code once, thus addressing the aforementioned problem of a missing value for p , but not addressing the missing value of q . In a world where OSS did not exist at all, then each piece of OSS software would not need to be rewritten just once, but instead would need to be rewritten by every firm that used the software (assuming the firm could freely share the software within its boundaries). Other research (Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; MurcianoGoroff, Zhuo, and Greenstein, 2021) has gone deeper into this hypothetical, albeit in a narrow\n",
       "\n",
       "manner, by only focusing on web servers (which are public facing on the Internet and can therefore be readily measured). Using different methods, both studies measure q for this one type of software and impute p by using a goods replacement value approach based on the prices for closed-source alternatives offered by firms. With data from the United States the resulting estimates show a value of  $2  billion  for  the  OSS  Apache  Web  Server  in  2012  (Greenstein  and  Nagle,  2014)  and  a combined value of $4.5 billion for Apache and the increasingly popular OSS web server nginx in 2018 (Murciano-Goroff, et al., 2021). However, although web servers are an important part of the OSS  ecosystem,  they  constitute  a  small  portion  of  it.  We  seek  to  build  upon  the  important contributions this existing research has made in an attempt to go both broad and deep to create a more complete measure of the value of OSS.\n",
       "\n",
       "To consider the value of OSS in both a broad and deep manner, we use data from two primary sources that allow us to gain insights into the OSS used at tens of thousands of firms across the world. The first is the 'Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries' (Nagle et al., 2022). The Census II project utilized partnerships with multiple software composition analysis (SCA) firms to create various lists of the most widely used OSS. SCAs are hired to scan the codebases of a company to ensure they are not violating any OSS licenses and, as a byproduct, track all the OSS code used by their customers and the products they build. The Census II project aggregated data from multiple SCAs to build a dataset of OSS usage at tens of thousands of firms based  on  millions  of  data  points  (observations  of  OSS  usage).  The  second  data  source  is  the BuiltWith dataset, from which we leverage scans of nearly nine million websites to identify the underlying technology deployed by these websites, including OSS libraries. The BuiltWith data has been used in multiple academic studies (DeStefano &amp; Timmis 2023, Dushnitsky &amp; Stroube 2021, Koning et al.. 2022), but to our knowledge this is the first one to focus on OSS usage. The Census II data and the BuiltWith data are complementary as the former focuses on OSS that is built  into  the  software  a  company  sells,  while  the  latter  focuses  on  OSS  that  is  built  into  a company's website, thus reducing the chances of double-counting observations across the datasets. In aggregate, these two datasets combined create the most complete measurement of OSS usage ( q ) to date. Further, by focusing on OSS that is widely deployed and used by firms, rather than considering all the projects that exist in an OSS repository, we enhance the methodologies of prior studies by reducing the likelihood of measurement error stemming from projects that are posted as publicly available OSS but are not actually used in any practical manner. Not accounting for this\n",
       "\n",
       "measurement error would lead to overestimation of the actual value of OSS as projects that are widely used would be valued in the same way as projects that are not used at all.\n",
       "\n",
       "To estimate p ,  we  follow  the  literature  discussed  above  and  use  the  labor  replacement value. First, we calculate the labor cost it would take an individual firm to recreate a given OSS package by measuring the number of lines of code within the package and then applying the Constructive Cost Model II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) - also known as COCOMO II to estimate the number of person-hours it would take to write the code from scratch. We then utilize global wage data from Salary Expert to get an accurate estimate of the labor costs a firm would incur if this piece of OSS did not exist. These costs can be combined with the q values from above at the OSS package level to estimate the combined value of all OSS from both the supply and demand sides.\n",
       "\n",
       "We find a value ranging from $1.22 billion to $6.22 billion if we were to decide as a society to recreate all widely used OSS on the supply side. However, considering the actual usage of OSS leads to a demand-side value that is orders of magnitude larger and ranges from $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion, if each firm who used an OSS package had to recreate it from scratch (e.g., the concept of OSS did not exist). We document substantial heterogeneity of the value of OSS by programming  language  and  internal  vs  outward-facing  programming  efforts.  Further,  we  find considerable  heterogeneity  in  value  contributions  by  programmers  as  5%  of  programmers  are responsible for more than 90% of the value created on the supply- and demand- side. The data we use is arguably the most comprehensive source of data to measure the value created by firm usage of OSS at this time. However, as for any project, the evidence is not complete and we argue that we underestimate the value since our data, e.g., does not include operating systems, which are a substantial omitted category of OSS.\n",
       "\n",
       "This study makes four important contributions to the academic literature, practitioners, and policy makers. First, it provides the most complete estimate of the value of widely used OSS to date  by  accounting  for  not  only  the  supply-side  of  OSS  (price  to  create  it),  but  also  for  the usage/demand-side at a scale that has not been done before. While prior estimates of the value of OSS only went either broad (estimating the supply-side costs of a large swath of OSS) or deep (estimating the value created by one particular type of OSS), this study does both by using unique datasets that allow for a better understanding of the breadth and depth of OSS usage. Further, rather than measuring the value of all OSS, this study focuses on the value of OSS that is used by firms\n",
       "\n",
       "to create its products and websites, limiting the measurement error occurring in studies that are unable to account for which OSS is actually used in production. This contribution builds upon, and extends, important research (e.g., Blind et al., 2021; Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021; Robbins et al., 2021) that has sought to identify the value of this vital resource that contributes a great deal to the modern economy despite the difficulties measuring this contribution. In  doing  so,  it  adds  insights  to  a  long-running  discussion  related  to  the  impact  of  information technology (IT) on productivity (Brynjolfsson, 1993; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 1996; Nagle, 2019a; Solow, 1987) known as the 'productivity paradox' where IT investments can have limited impact on productivity statistics. This debate has continued into the emerging context of AI (Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson, 2018). Our work contributes to this conversation by highlighting a massive societal level cost-savings (and hence productivity enhancement) that is created by the existence of OSS.\n",
       "\n",
       "Second, our research contributes methodological advances to the study of intangible capital by highlighting novel sources of data related to investments in OSS. Prior research has shown that intangible capital plays an increasingly important role in economic growth (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel,  2009)  and  firm  value  (Peters  and  Taylor,  2017),  but  it  often  goes  unmeasured  or misattributed (Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou, 2014). Further, we demonstrate how these data sources can be used to understand the true investments in software that a firm makes, and that which they would have to make if OSS did not exist.  This  is  valuable  as  investments  in  software  are  an increasingly important type of intangible capital that is driving innovation (Branstetter, Drev, and Kwon, 2019) and performance (Krishnan et al., 2000).\n",
       "\n",
       "Third, our results help highlight for firms and managers the importance of OSS to their production, and ideally add weight to arguments that users of OSS should not just free ride but also contribute to the creation and maintenance of OSS (e.g., Henkel, 2008; Nagle, 2018). Such contributions are a fraction of the costs that firms would incur if OSS did not exist and the active participation of OSS users in helping maintain the OSS they use is critical to the health and future well-being of the OSS ecosystem (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021; Zhang et al., 2019).\n",
       "\n",
       "Fourth,  and  finally,  our  study  helps  inform  policymakers  who  have  recently  started  to understand  the  growing  importance  of  OSS  to  the  economy  and  taken  actions  to  support  the ecosystem (European Commission, 2020; Executive Order No. 14028, 2021). However, most of these efforts are related to securing the existing OSS ecosystem, which is quite important, but do\n",
       "\n",
       "not go as far as supporting the creation of new OSS. Our results help shine light on the importance of OSS to the overall economy and add weight to calls for more societal support of this critical resource. Our results further show that the majority of the value created by OSS is created by a small  number  of  contributors.  Although  it  has  long  been  known  that  a  small  number  of  OSS contributors do most of the work, we add new insights that show this is even more true for the value creation of widely-used OSS projects and that societal support for these individuals is critical to the future success of OSS, and in turn, the economy.\n",
       "\n",
       "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the empirical setting and data. Section 3 discusses the methods including measurement challenges. In section 4, we estimate the value of open source software. Section 5 concludes.\n",
       "\n",
       "## 2. Empirical Setting and Data\n",
       "\n",
       "Although the concept of free and open software has existed since the 1950's, it became more popular in the 1980's due to the efforts of Richard Stallman and his launch of the GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation (Maracke, 2019). However, it was in the 1990's that OSS took off after Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel, a now widely adopted OSS operating system (Tozzi, 2016). Today, OSS is considered a key building block of the digital economy and is widely used by software developers in everything from phones to cars to refrigerators to cutting-edge AI (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021).\n",
       "\n",
       "We use two complementary main data sources to estimate the value of OSS. The first is the Census and is inward facing. It allows us to identify OSS code that goes into products that firms create. The second dataset is BuiltWith and is outward facing, allowing us to identify OSS code  that  consumers  directly  interact  with  through  firm  websites.  Since  the  raw  data  in  both datasets only contains package names, version numbers, and package manager names, and does not  contain  any  source  code  related  information,  we  first  obtain  the  publicly  accessible  code repository for each package which includes package-level information including the lines of code and  the  programming  languages  used.  One  may  worry  about  double-counting  for  the  value calculations as a result of using two separate datasets. However, the overlap of both the Census and  the  BuiltWith  sample  is  very  small:  there  are  only  18  packages  found  in  both  datasets. Moreover, it is unlikely that double counting is a concern as the two datasets capture different dimensions of OSS usage: the Census captures packaged software whose usage is inward-facing while BuiltWith captures usage in websites that are outward-facing. Finally, as a supplementary\n",
       "\n",
       "dataset, we use GHTorrent, a detailed history of OSS-related activity on GitHub, the most popular OSS hosting platform and a commonly used data source for studies of OSS (e.g., Burton et al, 2017; Conti, Peukert, and Roche, 2023; Fackler, Hofmann, and Laurentsyeva, 2023; Kim, 2020; Tang, Wang, &amp; Tong, 2023). This detailed historical data allows us to go deeper into how the value  of  OSS  is  created  by  better  understanding  the  dispersion  of  the  contributions  across individual OSS developers. We describe the details of all three data sources and their preparation for estimation below.\n",
       "\n",
       "Census. The  Census  II  of  Free  and  Open  Source  Software  (here:  Census)  was  jointly undertaken by the Linux Foundation and the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (Nagle et  al.,  2022). 1 The  Census  was  created  via  the  aggregation  of  data  from  three  major  software composition analysis (SCA) firms with thousands of clients across the globe. SCAs are hired to scan the codebase of a client and gather the OSS usage embedded in their proprietary software to ensure they are not violating any OSS license agreements.  Frequently this takes place as part of 2 the due diligence process related to mergers and acquisitions. Unlike other OSS demand measures available from public sources such as package download counts and code changes, the way this data was collected ensures that we observe the precise amount and type of internal OSS usage of the firms. In addition, it allows us to trace the dependencies each package relies on, so that we can observe the indirect OSS usage that is commonly hidden and difficult to obtain.  The result is over 3 2.7 million observations of OSS packages being used within products created by the SCA client firms for the calendar year 2020 (January 1 to December 31, 2020). 4\n",

A detailed discussion of OSS licenses can be found in Lerner and Tirole (2005) and Almeida et al (2017).\n",
       "\n",
       "3 Indirect OSS usage is captured by dependency analysis and is necessary to accurately measure the full breadth of the OSS a firm relies on. For example, if a firm's proprietary code calls OSS package A, but package A, in turn, calls package B, then only looking at the direct calls would miss that package B was a required building block for the firm's proprietary code.\n",
       "\n",
       "4 The Census defines an OSS package as 'a unit of software that can be installed and managed by a package manager,' and  defines  a  package  manager  as  'software  that  automates  the  process  of  installing  and  otherwise  managing packages' (Nagle et al, 2022).\n",
       "\n",
       "reported from the three of the most prominent SCA vendors to identify the most widely used OSS rather  than  the  long-tail  of  the  usage  distribution.  This  led  to  packages  with  less  than  five observations  of  usage  being  dropped.  Since  packages  written  in  the  JavaScript  programming language, and usually hosted on the Node Package Manager (NPM), are generally smaller (fewer lines  of  code)  than  packages  in  other  languages  and  therefore  frequently  have  higher  usage numbers (since developers must include many small packages instead of a few large packages), the Census separately selected the top 1,000 NPM packages and the top 1,000 non-NPM hosted packages.\n",
       "\n",
       "This final dataset covers 70% of the total usage of OSS observed in the raw data of the census.   For  each  of  these  2,000  OSS  packages  in  the  Census,  we  identified  the  raw  code 5 maintained on GitHub, the most widely used platform for hosting OSS.  We first attempted to 6 obtain the GitHub repository uniform resource locator (URL) for each package from libraries.io. We were able to match 1,657 packages to repositories via this initial method.  For URLs without 7 a  matching  repository,  we  performed  Google  searches  loosely  following  the  method  in  Singh (2020). More specifically, for each unmatched package, we used the Google API to search for the package name and 'GitHub Repository' and treated the first GitHub repository URL in the results as  its  best  matched  GitHub  URL.   This  resulted  in  an  additional  174  packages  matched  to  a 8 repository. Finally, we manually searched for URLs for the remaining 169 packages to identify the relevant repository. This entire process resulted in matching 1,840 out of the 2,000 Census packages to a code repository with the raw source code for the package. The unmatched packages were determined to have been either removed from GitHub or became proprietary (and thus the original source code was no longer available) and hence, the manual search allowed us to drop\n",

       "BuiltWith. The BuiltWith data contains scans of all public websites across the globe and identifies the technologies they use. Unlike the inward facing Census data which focus on the usage of OSS, the BuiltWith data scan for the use of both proprietary and OSS in firm websites without explicit differentiation. To separate OSS from proprietary software in BuiltWith, we turn to the subset of all open source web development software in the technology category that includes \"JavaScript and its libraries,\" which generates 778 observations corresponding to the NPM OSS category  in  the  Census  data.  There  are  two  reasons  for  this  sampling  choice.  First,  this  given category is constructed by BuiltWith and we use it as a proxy for OSS to separate it from pecuniary software.  Second,  JavaScript,  one  of  the  core  technologies  for  building  websites,  is  the  most popular programming language by usage on GitHub (GitHub, 2022) and thus enables us to capture the most important OSS from the demand side perspective. The scans include 8.8 million unique websites and 72.8 million corresponding observations of OSS usage from January 1 to November 16, 2020. Further, to ensure that we measure the value of OSS usage generated by the private sector,  we  match  the  adopting  domains  of  the  JavaScript-related  OSS  from  BuiltWith  with company websites recorded in Orbis, Compustat, and PitchBook, three commonly used databases of corporate activity that capture registered businesses across the world. Performing this match ensures that OSS used by non-commercial websites (e.g., an individual person's personal website) is excluded in our analysis. This results in a match-rate of 38.6%, which corresponds to around 3.4 million websites of distinct firms.\n",

We then manually searched the Github URLs for 83 of the remaining unmatched packages, resulting in an addition of 46 packages.

To obtain measures of the dispersion of the OSS value creation, we utilize  the  GHTorrent  database,  which  contains  the  entire  activity  history  on  GitHub  using GitHub's Representational State Transfer (REST) application programming interface (API). We leveraged  its  records  of  GitHub  repositories,  developer-level  commits,  and  developer  public profile information to estimate the contribution of each developer. We narrowed the sample for our developer contribution analysis in two steps. First, we winnowed the GitHub repositories and their  commits  from  GHTorrent  based  on  the  repository  URLs  of  our  joint  Census-BuiltWith sample. 10 Second, we focus on human contributions to OSS by removing approximately eight thousand (12%) GitHub contributors that we considered to be robots. 11 The final sample contains around sixty thousand developers and 2.3 million commits.\n",

Bucket 1 contains programming and markup languages (which are most likely to be human-written), bucket 3 contains data (most likely to be machine-written), and bucket 2 contains anything in between, such as config files and batch processing (which are sometimes human-written and sometimes machine-written, but it is difficult to tell based purely on looking at the code). 13 For our primary estimation we only use bucket 1 while providing robustness checks for buckets 2 and 3 in the Appendix, and thus our results represent a lower bound. Finally, for some analyses we dig deeper and show the top 5 programming languages (as classified by GitHub, 2022 for the year 2020; the year our data is from).

       "## 3. Methodology\n",
       "\n",
       "We first measure the value of OSS by considering the supply and the demand side of OSS using a labor market approach. 14 The thought experiment is that we live in a world where OSS does not exist and has to be recreated at each firm that uses a given piece of OSS. Using the labor market approach, we calculate the labor replacement cost of each OSS package. To estimate the value for each package, we use COCOMO II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) at the individual package level and then sum across all package values to obtain a supply-side labor market replacement value. Then, we scale the supply-side value by the number of times firms are using each package while removing multi-usage within each firm to obtain a demand-side value.\n",
       "\n",
       "Second, we move beyond the aggregate and inspect inequality in the value creation process. In OSS, as with many creative endeavors, it is common that a small handful of individuals provide the bulk of the contributions, while many others make small contributions (sometimes referred to as the 80/20 rule, implying 80% of the work is done by 20% of the people). Research has shown these frequent contributors often attain positions of influence in OSS communities as a result of their efforts (Hanisch, et al, 2018). Therefore, to better understand the dispersion of value creation across developers, we first use the GHTorrent data and identify individual developer contributions in two ways: a) through their OSS value contributions directly and b) through the total number of repositories they contributed to. We then test how concentrated these two contribution measures are to better understand whether many or few developers contribute to the total value we measure. We explain the exact details for the labor market approach and the inequality of valuations below.\n",
       "\n",
       "## 3.1 Labor market approach\n",

       "\n",
       "14 In an alternative version, we use a mixture of a labor and goods market approach that is more closely aligned with Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff, et al (2021). However, applying this method in our setting requires numerous additional assumptions due to data constraints. For simplicity we call it the goods market approach for which we provide the details and statistics, as well as the limitations in Appendix A.\n",

       "\n",
       "In this calculation, we implicitly do not incorporate any production externalities since we assume that there is no spillover knowledge from one package to the next that would lower the cost of programming. 16 This methodology is similar to that used by other papers that estimate the supply-side costs of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021).\n",

       "\n",
       "Here, we do not incorporate consumption externalities, i.e., we do not allow a benefit to arise for the general public when a package has been created and we further make sure that each firm is only replacing a package they use once, since a replaced package can be used within a firm as a club good (e.g., see Cornes and Sandler, 1996). The value 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost to rewrite all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the concept of OSS still exists, but all of these packages needed to be rewritten from scratch), while the value 𝑉 + \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost for each firm that uses one of these OSS packages to pay a developer to rewrite those packages (e.g., OSS itself no longer exists).\n",

The parameter 𝜂 is an effort-adjustment factor which can be modified to incorporate subjective assessments of product, hardware, personnel, and project attributes.

To obtain the price ( 𝑃 ( ) of each OSS project, we  then  multiply  the  results  of  equation  (3)  by  the  weighted  global  wage  that  an  average programmer would obtain on the open market. To calculate a global wage, we include the base monthly salaries of software developers from Salary Expert for the top 30 countries in terms of their GitHub developer counts in 2021 (Wachs et al., 2022). 17 The weight of each country is its share of active GitHub contributors over the total contributors in the top 30 countries. We further create bounds by using a low-wage (India) and high-wage (USA) labor market for the wage to better understand how the value would vary by the pool of programmers used to recreate all of OSS. 18\n",

To  graphically  examine  the  dispersion  of developer contribution values, we utilized Lorenz curves (Lorenz, 1905), with respect to both demand and supply side values. Lorenz curves are a well-established way to represent inequality and, as such, they allow us to better understand how dispersed developer contributions to OSS within the private economy are. Developers are systematically arranged in ascending order based on their contributions to OSS demand and supply, as delineated in Equation (7). Subsequently, these ranks were normalized to a scale ranging from 0 to 100 percentiles, serving as the x-axis values for the Lorenz Curves.

The  inward-facing Census  (Panel  A)  contains  just  over  261.7  million  lines  of  code  with  72%  of  the  lines  being attributable to the top programming languages. The average package includes 142 thousand lines of code with a slightly lower average of 113 thousand lines of code for the subset of top languages. When considering the demand (usage) side, we observe that the Census packages were used over 2.7 million times while 92% of this usage is attributable to the top languages. The average package was used 1,472.4 times with a higher usage of around 1,497.5 for the top  languages.  For  the outward-facing  BuiltWith  data  we  find  similar  patterns,  but  at  different  levels.  The  packages included from BuiltWith include over 82 million lines of code, 71% of which are attributable to the  top  programming  languages.  The  average  package  within  the  BuiltWith  sample  has  111 thousand  lines  of  code  with  a  lower  average  of  around  80  thousand  lines  of  code  for  the  top languages. This is because our BuiltWith data primarily consists of JavaScript-based packages, which are often smaller than packages written in other languages. BuiltWith packages were used over 142 thousand times where 99.97% were attributable to the top languages. Next, we used these raw observations to calculate the value of all OSS through the labor market approach and estimated the value created from the supply and demand side.\n",

       "Table 2 shows the estimates for the value of OSS based on the firm-relevant joint Census and BuiltWith sample. All estimates in Table 2 are based only on software languages classified in bucket  1  from  Table  A1,  which  are  the  most  likely  to  be  written  by  a  human  rather  than  a machine. 19 The first column contains estimates with wages from a low income country (India), the global  average  wage,  and  a  high  income  country  (United  States  of  America),  respectively  (as described above). To reproduce all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the idea of OSS still exists, but all current OSS is deleted and needs to be coded from scratch), using programmers at the average developer wage from India, it would require an investment of $1.22 billion. In contrast, if we use the average developer wage from the United States, then reproducing all widely-used OSS would require  an  investment  of  $6.22  billion.  Using  a  pool  of  programmers  from  across  the  world, weighed based on the existing geographic contributions to OSS as discussed above, would lead to an investment somewhere in between the low and high-income country, $4.15 billion. It is useful to compare these numbers to those from similar studies to understand differences in valuing all OSS (prior studies) versus that which is widely used (our study). Robbins et al. (2021) and Blind et al. (2021) use a method similar to ours and estimate that the value of OSS created in the US is $38 billion in 2019 and that created in the EU is €1 billion in 2018. Wachs et al. (2022) show that roughly 50% of OSS contributions come from the US and EU combined. In aggregate, that would lead these studies to give a global value of OSS of $78 billion. Thus, our middle estimate of a supply-side value of $4.15 billion for only firm-oriented and widely used OSS is a credible lowerbound and highlights the higher estimations of the total of supply-side value of OSS when not considering whether or not a given OSS package is widely used. This further indicates that the supply-side value of the most widely used OSS is roughly 5.5% of the supply-side value of all OSS.\n",

However, this represents a flow, not a stock, of software. Relying on government estimates that software fully depreciates over three years, we can do a back of the envelope calculation and consider the purchase value of the full stock of prepackaged software used in 2020 as the aggregate of that sold from 2018 to 2020, which is $1.54 trillion. Further, this represents only the expenditure on prepackaged software and does  not  include  custom  purchased  or  in-house  developed  software.  Here,  the  best  obtainable estimates of private-sector investment in software overall come from the United States National Income and Product Accounts data (NIPA 2023). In 2020, the national account data shows that in the  US,  private  firms  spent  $479.2  billion  on  software,  of  which  45%  ($215.5  billion)  was prepackaged. If we assume this is a consistent ratio for the rest of the world, then the total amount firms spent on software being used in 2020 was $3.4 trillion (= $1.54 trillion/0.45). Combining this rough estimate with the demand side estimate of the value of OSS based on an average global wage ($8.8 trillion), this indicates firms would spend $12.2 trillion (=$3.4 trillion + $8.8 trillion), or three and a half times what they currently spend if they needed to pay in-house developers to write the OSS that they currently use for free.\n",

In both Panel A and Panel B we can also see a rise in the number of repositories for the last 10-15% of programmers that contribute  to  the  highest  value,  which  implies  that  the  uneven  value  that  is generated by few programmers is not just due to a few highly valuable repositories but by the contributions of this handful of contributors to a substantial number of repositories.\n",

While we do not focus on the long tail of OSS, we consider this an additional contribution of our study as focusing on OSS that is widely used allows us to more precisely understand the value created by OSS, rather than only measuring the  replacement  cost  for  all  OSS  (which  would  overestimate  the  true  value  since  many  OSS projects are not used in production code). However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n",
       "\n",
       "Adjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.  We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves.  Over  95%  percent  of  the  demand-side  value  is  generated  by  only  five  percent  of programmers, and those programmers contribute not only to a few widely used projects but to substantially more projects than the programmers that are engaged at the lower end of the value distribution.\n",
       "\n",
       "In aggregate, our results show the substantial value that OSS contributes to the economy despite this value generally showing up as zero via direct measurement since prices equal zero and quantity is difficult to measure using public data alone. Our research lays the groundwork for future studies of not only OSS, but of all IT and its growing impact on the global economy.\n",

       "\n",
       "As an alternate estimation method, instead of using the labor replacement cost, we use a goods replacement value approach. We identify several OSS packages that have similar closed-source, pecuniary alternatives and consider the costs if all commercial users of the free OSS had to replace that software with a pecuniary alternative (similar to the calculations Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) performed for web servers). We can then use this alternate value of p , combined with the q values from above to estimate a goods replacement value of OSS. This method builds on suggestions from Nordhaus (2006, p. 146) who says '…the price of market and nonmarket goods and services should be imputed on the basis of the comparable market goods and services.' We do not expect the estimates from the two methods to be similar. Quite the contrary, the value of those two methods varies substantially since the latter goods-market approach assumes a fixed price to sell a good multiple times and that fixed price is usually lower than the total value estimated from recreating all packages on the labor side. The differential between these estimates is  essentially the result of a firm stepping in to reproduce the missing OSS packages and then selling them for a pecuniary price rather than all firms needing to reproduce those packages from scratch themselves.\n",
       "\n",
       "With the goods market approach, the thought experiment is still that we live in a world where OSS does not exist, but it has to be recreated via one firm that then charges a price for a good that is currently free. To value OSS via the goods market approach, we created a basket of equivalent substitute proprietary goods that are priced on the open market as a stand-in for an OSS product.  This  methodology  is  consistent  with  that  used  in  the  prior  literature  (Greenstein  and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021) although both of those studies only used a single good rather than a basket since they were focused on only one type of OSS (web servers). Since there is no readily available database for proprietary equivalents of OSS, we conduct a search based on subjective  perception  of  popularity  of  OSS  and  we  then  search  for  pecuniary,  closed-source substitutes for them. The resulting basket of 20 OSS packages with proprietary substitutes is a good representation of the diversity of OSS. The software ranges from media and design software to statistical analysis programs, to database management and web server software. 21\n",
       "\n",
       "21 Table A5 shows the basket of OSS and their proprietary equivalents that we used. To create this basket, we looked for proprietary software that had an OSS equivalent that was similar in its overall function and feature set, and sought to identify pairs of software that, in aggregate, captured a broad and representative set of the types of OSS that exist.\n",
       "\n",
       "Based on our OSS equivalent substitute proprietary goods basket we then obtain prices for each proprietary software equivalent and we calculated the COCOMO labor market supply-side value for each OSS product in the basket which we use as a proxy - for lack of the code from the proprietary software - for the COCOMO labor supply side value of the proprietary software (e.g., the cost it would take to pay a programmer to write that proprietary software from scratch). We then calculate the average COCOMO labor supply-side value of the basket, 𝑉 !,1#23.4 ,  and  the average price for the basket, 𝑃 !,1#23.4 . 22 Since, we know the labor market supply-side value of all OSS, 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; , we can setup the following equation and obtain the price of OSS, 𝑃 ! for the goodsmarket for all OSS via a simple scaling transformation:\n",

       "\n",
       "Table A6, column 3 shows that the value on the demand side ranges between $177 million and $244 million across the different buckets independent of the country of origin from which programmers are hired. Naturally, the goods-market value will be substantially smaller than the labor demand value since this imaginary firm will make a profit at a comparatively low price by producing the software once and then selling it to many customers. Further, while Greenstein and Nagle (2014) as well as Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) focus on one particular type of software only (web servers), we attempt to expand on their approach to many goods. However, the data limitations become a stronger constraint in this context which makes it inherently more difficult\n",
       "\n",
       "22 We obtained the average price of the goods-market proprietary basket by using a 3 years lifespan of software, i.e. 1/(1-0.66), so the depreciation factor is 0.33. This is consistent with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules for depreciating software, which states 'If you can depreciate the cost of computer software, use the straight line method over a useful life of 36 months.' https://www.irs.gov/publications/p946#en\\_US\\_2022\\_publink1000107354.\n",

       "to  estimate  the  value  through  this  approach  while  requiring  substantially  more  assumptions. Instead of a pure goods-market approach, this requires assistance from the labor-market approach in terms of scaling for the estimate, which ultimately leads to a substantial underestimate of the value of OSS. Further, the pricing strategy of the proprietary software counterparts is sensitive to the  market  demand.  With  the  goods-market  approach  extending  to  multiple  goods,  the  strong implicit assumption is that the market demands for our basket software and our sample OSS are similar, so they lead to commensurate prices.\n",
       "\n",
       "An alternative and even more simplified goods-market back-of-the-envelope calculation that does not account for lines of code and relies on no scaling from the labor market approach would simply be to multiply a price of a reference good with the usage. We can take the minimum, average, and maximum prices of the basket of proprietary goods as captured in the reference price vector p = (69.99, 1610.17, 5800) and simply multiply it with usage from the combined Census and BuiltWith sample (Table 1). Based on those imputed proprietary price assumptions, the goods market demand side value would range from $0.2 - $16.5 trillion (minimum price - maximum price)  with  the  mean  price  resulting  in  a  value  estimate  of  $4.5  trillion.  However,  while  this estimate creates slightly more variance than the labor market approach, it is inherently flawed by simply assuming that the imputed prices are identical for each open source product based on the reference price. We further think this very simple back-of-the-envelope is an orange to apples comparison since the goods in our basket are fully functional, stand-alone software packages, while the packages in the Census and BuiltWith datasets are comprised of application libraries, which are generally smaller than such stand-alone packages.\n",
       "\n",
       "Given all the complexities and assumptions one has to make due to lack of data for a goodsmarket approach, we place stronger emphasis on the labor cost approach highlighted in the main body but we include this method here for completeness."
