A  pervasive example is open source software (OSS), a global public good that plays a vital role in the economy and is foundational for most technology we use today. However, it is difficult to measure the value of OSS due to its non-pecuniary nature and lack of centralized usage tracking. Therefore, OSS remains largely unaccounted for in economic measures. Although prior studies have estimated the supply-side costs to recreate this software, a lack of data has hampered estimating the much larger demand-side (usage) value created by OSS. Therefore, to understand the complete economic and social value of widely-used OSS, we leverage unique global data from two complementary sources capturing  OSS  usage  by  millions  of  global  firms.  We  first  estimate  the  supply-side  value  by calculating the cost to recreate the most widely used OSS once. We then calculate the demandside value based on a replacement value for each firm that uses the software and would need to build it internally if OSS did not exist. We estimate the supply-side value of widely-used OSS is $4.15 billion, but that the demand-side value is much larger at $8.8 trillion. We find that firms would need to spend 3.5 times more on software than they currently do if OSS did not exist. The top six programming languages in our sample comprise 84% of the demand-side value of OSS. Further, 96% of the demand-side value is created by only 5% of OSS developers.\n\nJEL Classification:\n\nH4; O3; J0\n\nKeywords: Open-source software, global public good\n\nAcknowledgement: The authors are grateful for  financial  and  administrative  support  from  the Linux  Foundation  without  which  the  data  from  the  Census  would  not  have  otherwise  been available.

Introduction\n\nIn 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that 'software is eating the world' (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that 'open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,' (Jacks, 2022). Other recent studies have come to similar conclusions showing that open source software  (OSS)  -  software  whose  source  code  is  publicly  available  for  inspection,  use,  and modification and is often created in a decentralized manner and distributed for free - appears in 96% of codebases (Synopsys 2023), and that some commercial software consists of up to 99.9% freely available OSS (Musseau et al., 2022). Although in its early days OSS frequently copied features from existing proprietary software, OSS today includes cutting edge technology in various fields including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, big data, and analytics.  However, despite the increasing importance of OSS to all software (and therefore to the entire economy), measuring its impact has been elusive. Traditionally, to measure the value created by a good or service,  economists  multiply  the  price  ( p )  times  the  quantity  sold  ( q ).  However,  in  OSS, p is generally zero since the source code is publicly available, and q is  unknown due to the limited number of restrictions around how the code may be copied and reused. For example, if a company downloads  a  piece  of  OSS  from  a  public  code  repository,  it  may  copy  it  thousands  of  times internally (legally) and then share it with suppliers or customers (also legally), so public download data is insufficient. Although some recent studies have sought to estimate the value of p (discussed below), data for estimating q has been unavailable or intractable for anything more than just a handful of OSS packages. Using newly collected data from multiple sources, the goal of this paper is to provide estimates for both p and q and to use those to shine light on the question: What is the value of open source software?\n\nUnderstanding the value of OSS is of critical importance not only due to the role it plays in the economy, but also due to it being one of the most successful and impactful modern examples of the centuries old economic concept of 'the commons' which run the risk of meeting the fate known as 'the tragedy of the commons.' This concept can trace its roots as far back as the 4 th -century BC philosopher Aristotle who wrote 'That which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care. Men pay most attention to what is their own and care less for what is common.'  (Aristotle,  1981).  William  Forster  Lloyd  (1833)  resurfaced  the  idea  in  modern economic thought by highlighting the example of shared tracts of land used for cattle grazing by\n\nmultiple cattle herders who each had an incentive to overuse the shared resource. Garrett Hardin (1968)  brought  the  concept  into  the  broader  zeitgeist  when  he  wrote  an  article  discussing  the problem entitled 'The Tragedy of the Commons.' Building on this work, Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for her research highlighting paths to avoiding the tragedy of the commons through community coordination efforts that did not necessitate government enforced laws to manage and guard the commons (Ostrom 1990). The parallels between shared grazing lands and shared digital infrastructure are palpable - the availability of communal grass to feed cattle, and in turn feed people, was critical to the agrarian economy, and the ability to not have to recreate code that someone else has already written is critical to the modern economy. Further, in both contexts, despite knowing grass and code are critical inputs to the economy, measuring their actual value is difficult. And, as the renowned mathematician and physicist Lord Kelvin is believed to have said, 'If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.' And if you cannot improve and maintain it, such common goods may crumble under the weight of their own success as they are overused, but underinvested in (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021). Therefore, measuring the value OSS creates is crucial to the future health of the digital economy, and the rest of the economy that is built on top of it.\n\nImportantly, recent studies have attempted to address these measurement issues but fall short of capturing both the breadth and depth of OSS usage - a gap we seek to fill with this paper. For example, researchers have attempted to gain breadth by using novel methodologies to estimate the labor replacement value of the current corpus of OSS created in the United States at $38 billion in 2019 (Robbins et al., 2021) and that created in the European Union at €1 billion (Blind et al., 2021) by imputing the labor costs that it would have taken to rewrite existing OSS. Such efforts do a very good job at estimating what it would cost to replace all existing OSS if it disappeared tomorrow. However, the resultant estimates rely on two important assumptions. First, that all OSS is equally valuable from a usage standpoint, and second that the concept of OSS would still exist, and society would just need to rewrite the code once, thus addressing the aforementioned problem of a missing value for p , but not addressing the missing value of q . In a world where OSS did not exist at all, then each piece of OSS software would not need to be rewritten just once, but instead would need to be rewritten by every firm that used the software (assuming the firm could freely share the software within its boundaries). Other research (Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; MurcianoGoroff, Zhuo, and Greenstein, 2021) has gone deeper into this hypothetical, albeit in a narrow\n\nmanner, by only focusing on web servers (which are public facing on the Internet and can therefore be readily measured). Using different methods, both studies measure q for this one type of software and impute p by using a goods replacement value approach based on the prices for closed-source alternatives offered by firms. With data from the United States the resulting estimates show a value of  $2  billion  for  the  OSS  Apache  Web  Server  in  2012  (Greenstein  and  Nagle,  2014)  and  a combined value of $4.5 billion for Apache and the increasingly popular OSS web server nginx in 2018 (Murciano-Goroff, et al., 2021). However, although web servers are an important part of the OSS  ecosystem,  they  constitute  a  small  portion  of  it.  We  seek  to  build  upon  the  important contributions this existing research has made in an attempt to go both broad and deep to create a more complete measure of the value of OSS.\n\nTo consider the value of OSS in both a broad and deep manner, we use data from two primary sources that allow us to gain insights into the OSS used at tens of thousands of firms across the world. The first is the 'Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries' (Nagle et al., 2022). The Census II project utilized partnerships with multiple software composition analysis (SCA) firms to create various lists of the most widely used OSS. SCAs are hired to scan the codebases of a company to ensure they are not violating any OSS licenses and, as a byproduct, track all the OSS code used by their customers and the products they build. The Census II project aggregated data from multiple SCAs to build a dataset of OSS usage at tens of thousands of firms based  on  millions  of  data  points  (observations  of  OSS  usage).  The  second  data  source  is  the BuiltWith dataset, from which we leverage scans of nearly nine million websites to identify the underlying technology deployed by these websites, including OSS libraries. The BuiltWith data has been used in multiple academic studies (DeStefano &amp; Timmis 2023, Dushnitsky &amp; Stroube 2021, Koning et al.. 2022), but to our knowledge this is the first one to focus on OSS usage. The Census II data and the BuiltWith data are complementary as the former focuses on OSS that is built  into  the  software  a  company  sells,  while  the  latter  focuses  on  OSS  that  is  built  into  a company's website, thus reducing the chances of double-counting observations across the datasets. In aggregate, these two datasets combined create the most complete measurement of OSS usage ( q ) to date. Further, by focusing on OSS that is widely deployed and used by firms, rather than considering all the projects that exist in an OSS repository, we enhance the methodologies of prior studies by reducing the likelihood of measurement error stemming from projects that are posted as publicly available OSS but are not actually used in any practical manner. Not accounting for this\n\nmeasurement error would lead to overestimation of the actual value of OSS as projects that are widely used would be valued in the same way as projects that are not used at all.\n\nTo estimate p ,  we  follow  the  literature  discussed  above  and  use  the  labor  replacement value. First, we calculate the labor cost it would take an individual firm to recreate a given OSS package by measuring the number of lines of code within the package and then applying the Constructive Cost Model II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) - also known as COCOMO II to estimate the number of person-hours it would take to write the code from scratch. We then utilize global wage data from Salary Expert to get an accurate estimate of the labor costs a firm would incur if this piece of OSS did not exist. These costs can be combined with the q values from above at the OSS package level to estimate the combined value of all OSS from both the supply and demand sides.\n\nWe find a value ranging from $1.22 billion to $6.22 billion if we were to decide as a society to recreate all widely used OSS on the supply side. However, considering the actual usage of OSS leads to a demand-side value that is orders of magnitude larger and ranges from $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion, if each firm who used an OSS package had to recreate it from scratch (e.g., the concept of OSS did not exist). We document substantial heterogeneity of the value of OSS by programming  language  and  internal  vs  outward-facing  programming  efforts.  Further,  we  find considerable  heterogeneity  in  value  contributions  by  programmers  as  5%  of  programmers  are responsible for more than 90% of the value created on the supply- and demand- side. The data we use is arguably the most comprehensive source of data to measure the value created by firm usage of OSS at this time. However, as for any project, the evidence is not complete and we argue that we underestimate the value since our data, e.g., does not include operating systems, which are a substantial omitted category of OSS.\n\nThis study makes four important contributions to the academic literature, practitioners, and policy makers. First, it provides the most complete estimate of the value of widely used OSS to date  by  accounting  for  not  only  the  supply-side  of  OSS  (price  to  create  it),  but  also  for  the usage\/demand-side at a scale that has not been done before. While prior estimates of the value of OSS only went either broad (estimating the supply-side costs of a large swath of OSS) or deep (estimating the value created by one particular type of OSS), this study does both by using unique datasets that allow for a better understanding of the breadth and depth of OSS usage. Further, rather than measuring the value of all OSS, this study focuses on the value of OSS that is used by firms\n\nto create its products and websites, limiting the measurement error occurring in studies that are unable to account for which OSS is actually used in production. This contribution builds upon, and extends, important research (e.g., Blind et al., 2021; Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021; Robbins et al., 2021) that has sought to identify the value of this vital resource that contributes a great deal to the modern economy despite the difficulties measuring this contribution. In  doing  so,  it  adds  insights  to  a  long-running  discussion  related  to  the  impact  of  information technology (IT) on productivity (Brynjolfsson, 1993; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 1996; Nagle, 2019a; Solow, 1987) known as the 'productivity paradox' where IT investments can have limited impact on productivity statistics. This debate has continued into the emerging context of AI (Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson, 2018). Our work contributes to this conversation by highlighting a massive societal level cost-savings (and hence productivity enhancement) that is created by the existence of OSS.\n\nSecond, our research contributes methodological advances to the study of intangible capital by highlighting novel sources of data related to investments in OSS. Prior research has shown that intangible capital plays an increasingly important role in economic growth (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel,  2009)  and  firm  value  (Peters  and  Taylor,  2017),  but  it  often  goes  unmeasured  or misattributed (Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou, 2014). Further, we demonstrate how these data sources can be used to understand the true investments in software that a firm makes, and that which they would have to make if OSS did not exist.  This  is  valuable  as  investments  in  software  are  an increasingly important type of intangible capital that is driving innovation (Branstetter, Drev, and Kwon, 2019) and performance (Krishnan et al., 2000).\n\nThird, our results help highlight for firms and managers the importance of OSS to their production, and ideally add weight to arguments that users of OSS should not just free ride but also contribute to the creation and maintenance of OSS (e.g., Henkel, 2008; Nagle, 2018). Such contributions are a fraction of the costs that firms would incur if OSS did not exist and the active participation of OSS users in helping maintain the OSS they use is critical to the health and future well-being of the OSS ecosystem (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021; Zhang et al., 2019).\n\nFourth,  and  finally,  our  study  helps  inform  policymakers  who  have  recently  started  to understand  the  growing  importance  of  OSS  to  the  economy  and  taken  actions  to  support  the ecosystem (European Commission, 2020; Executive Order No. 14028, 2021). However, most of these efforts are related to securing the existing OSS ecosystem, which is quite important, but do\n\nnot go as far as supporting the creation of new OSS. Our results help shine light on the importance of OSS to the overall economy and add weight to calls for more societal support of this critical resource. Our results further show that the majority of the value created by OSS is created by a small  number  of  contributors.  Although  it  has  long  been  known  that  a  small  number  of  OSS contributors do most of the work, we add new insights that show this is even more true for the value creation of widely-used OSS projects and that societal support for these individuals is critical to the future success of OSS, and in turn, the economy.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the empirical setting and data. Section 3 discusses the methods including measurement challenges. In section 4, we estimate the value of open source software. Section 5 concludes.\n\nDocument 16: ## 5. Conclusion\n\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith. We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average value and distributed it across industries.\n\nIn this study we estimate the value of widely-used open source software globally with two unique datasets: the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data. We are able to estimate not only the supply side value of existing code (e.g., the cost it would take to rewrite each piece of widely-used OSS once) but also the demand side value for the private economy (e.g., the cost it would take for each company that uses a piece of OSS to rewrite it). While we do not focus on the long tail of OSS, we consider this an additional contribution of our study as focusing on OSS that is widely used allows us to more precisely understand the value created by OSS, rather than only measuring the  replacement  cost  for  all  OSS  (which  would  overestimate  the  true  value  since  many  OSS projects are not used in production code). However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n\nAdjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.  We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves.  Over  95%  percent  of  the  demand-side  value  is  generated  by  only  five  percent  of programmers, and those programmers contribute not only to a few widely used projects but to substantially more projects than the programmers that are engaged at the lower end of the value distribution.\n\nIn aggregate, our results show the substantial value that OSS contributes to the economy despite this value generally showing up as zero via direct measurement since prices equal zero and quantity is difficult to measure using public data alone. Our research lays the groundwork for future studies of not only OSS, but of all IT and its growing impact on the global economy.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"simple","seed_document_id":5,"topic":"Others"}}

We ask how much it would cost to reproduce the package by hiring a programmer and paying them a competitive market wage. To estimate this supply-side value ( 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; ) , we take the complete list of OSS packages discussed above, and then count the lines of code in each unique\n\n14 In an alternative version, we use a mixture of a labor and goods market approach that is more closely aligned with Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff, et al (2021). However, applying this method in our setting requires numerous additional assumptions due to data constraints. For simplicity we call it the goods market approach for which we provide the details and statistics, as well as the limitations in Appendix A.\n\npackage. 15 For each unique package,  , we calculate the value and then sum over all these values i to obtain the total value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nIn this calculation, we implicitly do not incorporate any production externalities since we assume that there is no spillover knowledge from one package to the next that would lower the cost of programming. 16 This methodology is similar to that used by other papers that estimate the supply-side costs of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021).\n\nWe then calculate the demand-side value of OSS by incorporating the usage information ( Q) for each package:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nHere, we do not incorporate consumption externalities, i.e., we do not allow a benefit to arise for the general public when a package has been created and we further make sure that each firm is only replacing a package they use once, since a replaced package can be used within a firm as a club good (e.g., see Cornes and Sandler, 1996). The value 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost to rewrite all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the concept of OSS still exists, but all of these packages needed to be rewritten from scratch), while the value 𝑉 + \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost for each firm that uses one of these OSS packages to pay a developer to rewrite those packages (e.g., OSS itself no longer exists).\n\nFor both the supply and demand models, we obtain the dollar-value for each package ( 𝑃 ( ) via the Constructive Cost Model II, also abbreviated as COCOMO II (Boehm 1984, Boehm et al. 2009). The model has previously been used by the United States Department of Defense to estimate software project costs as well as in prior research estimating the value of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021). It is a highly flexible model that allows us to create non-linear transformations of lines of code to dollar-values. It uses the following modelling equation:\n\n15 We use only the pure lines of code excluding documentation lines and empty lines. Hence, we underestimate the true value of recreating each package.\n\n16 Similar to a representative agent model (e.g. see Williamson 2006), one may think of each package being reproduced by separate programmers who are identical replicas of each other (and therefore have the same skill level, but do not become more efficient via learning).\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n( (\n\nwhere 𝐿 represents the lines of codes in thousands and E the effort in person-month units for each project  . Consistent with Blind et al. (2021), we use the default parameter values for i 𝛼 , 𝛽 and 𝜂. The parameters 𝛼 𝛽 , are non-linear adjustment factors set to 2.94, and 1.0997 respectively . The parameter 𝜂 is an effort-adjustment factor which can be modified to incorporate subjective assessments of product, hardware, personnel, and project attributes. Since we do not have a prior for each project, we set 𝜂 to the default value of one. To obtain the price ( 𝑃 ( ) of each OSS project, we  then  multiply  the  results  of  equation  (3)  by  the  weighted  global  wage  that  an  average programmer would obtain on the open market. To calculate a global wage, we include the base monthly salaries of software developers from Salary Expert for the top 30 countries in terms of their GitHub developer counts in 2021 (Wachs et al., 2022). 17 The weight of each country is its share of active GitHub contributors over the total contributors in the top 30 countries. We further create bounds by using a low-wage (India) and high-wage (USA) labor market for the wage to better understand how the value would vary by the pool of programmers used to recreate all of OSS. 18\n\nDocument 8: ## 3. Methodology\n\nWe first measure the value of OSS by considering the supply and the demand side of OSS using a labor market approach. 14 The thought experiment is that we live in a world where OSS does not exist and has to be recreated at each firm that uses a given piece of OSS. Using the labor market approach, we calculate the labor replacement cost of each OSS package. To estimate the value for each package, we use COCOMO II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) at the individual package level and then sum across all package values to obtain a supply-side labor market replacement value. Then, we scale the supply-side value by the number of times firms are using each package while removing multi-usage within each firm to obtain a demand-side value.\n\nSecond, we move beyond the aggregate and inspect inequality in the value creation process. In OSS, as with many creative endeavors, it is common that a small handful of individuals provide the bulk of the contributions, while many others make small contributions (sometimes referred to as the 80\/20 rule, implying 80% of the work is done by 20% of the people). Research has shown these frequent contributors often attain positions of influence in OSS communities as a result of their efforts (Hanisch, et al, 2018). Therefore, to better understand the dispersion of value creation across developers, we first use the GHTorrent data and identify individual developer contributions in two ways: a) through their OSS value contributions directly and b) through the total number of repositories they contributed to. We then test how concentrated these two contribution measures are to better understand whether many or few developers contribute to the total value we measure. We explain the exact details for the labor market approach and the inequality of valuations below.\n\nDocument 21: ## Appendix A) Goods-Market Valuation Approach\n\nAs an alternate estimation method, instead of using the labor replacement cost, we use a goods replacement value approach. We identify several OSS packages that have similar closed-source, pecuniary alternatives and consider the costs if all commercial users of the free OSS had to replace that software with a pecuniary alternative (similar to the calculations Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) performed for web servers). We can then use this alternate value of p , combined with the q values from above to estimate a goods replacement value of OSS. This method builds on suggestions from Nordhaus (2006, p. 146) who says '…the price of market and nonmarket goods and services should be imputed on the basis of the comparable market goods and services.' We do not expect the estimates from the two methods to be similar. Quite the contrary, the value of those two methods varies substantially since the latter goods-market approach assumes a fixed price to sell a good multiple times and that fixed price is usually lower than the total value estimated from recreating all packages on the labor side. The differential between these estimates is  essentially the result of a firm stepping in to reproduce the missing OSS packages and then selling them for a pecuniary price rather than all firms needing to reproduce those packages from scratch themselves.\n\nWith the goods market approach, the thought experiment is still that we live in a world where OSS does not exist, but it has to be recreated via one firm that then charges a price for a good that is currently free. To value OSS via the goods market approach, we created a basket of equivalent substitute proprietary goods that are priced on the open market as a stand-in for an OSS product.  This  methodology  is  consistent  with  that  used  in  the  prior  literature  (Greenstein  and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021) although both of those studies only used a single good rather than a basket since they were focused on only one type of OSS (web servers). Since there is no readily available database for proprietary equivalents of OSS, we conduct a search based on subjective  perception  of  popularity  of  OSS  and  we  then  search  for  pecuniary,  closed-source substitutes for them. The resulting basket of 20 OSS packages with proprietary substitutes is a good representation of the diversity of OSS. The software ranges from media and design software to statistical analysis programs, to database management and web server software. 21\n\n21 Table A5 shows the basket of OSS and their proprietary equivalents that we used. To create this basket, we looked for proprietary software that had an OSS equivalent that was similar in its overall function and feature set, and sought to identify pairs of software that, in aggregate, captured a broad and representative set of the types of OSS that exist.\n\nBased on our OSS equivalent substitute proprietary goods basket we then obtain prices for each proprietary software equivalent and we calculated the COCOMO labor market supply-side value for each OSS product in the basket which we use as a proxy - for lack of the code from the proprietary software - for the COCOMO labor supply side value of the proprietary software (e.g., the cost it would take to pay a programmer to write that proprietary software from scratch). We then calculate the average COCOMO labor supply-side value of the basket, 𝑉 !,1#23.4 ,  and  the average price for the basket, 𝑃 !,1#23.4 . 22 Since, we know the labor market supply-side value of all OSS, 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; , we can setup the following equation and obtain the price of OSS, 𝑃 ! for the goodsmarket for all OSS via a simple scaling transformation:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nThis results in the following goods-market supply-side value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nWe can then obtain the equivalent demand-side goods-market values as follows:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nFrom the goods market side, we consider the equivalent price that a firm would charge if it produced all existing widely used OSS and then sold it as a product to customers.\n\nTable A6, column 3 shows that the value on the demand side ranges between $177 million and $244 million across the different buckets independent of the country of origin from which programmers are hired. Naturally, the goods-market value will be substantially smaller than the labor demand value since this imaginary firm will make a profit at a comparatively low price by producing the software once and then selling it to many customers. Further, while Greenstein and Nagle (2014) as well as Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) focus on one particular type of software only (web servers), we attempt to expand on their approach to many goods. However, the data limitations become a stronger constraint in this context which makes it inherently more difficult\n\n22 We obtained the average price of the goods-market proprietary basket by using a 3 years lifespan of software, i.e. 1\/(1-0.66), so the depreciation factor is 0.33. This is consistent with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules for depreciating software, which states 'If you can depreciate the cost of computer software, use the straight line method over a useful life of 36 months.' https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/publications\/p946#en\\_US\\_2022\\_publink1000107354.\n\nto  estimate  the  value  through  this  approach  while  requiring  substantially  more  assumptions. Instead of a pure goods-market approach, this requires assistance from the labor-market approach in terms of scaling for the estimate, which ultimately leads to a substantial underestimate of the value of OSS. Further, the pricing strategy of the proprietary software counterparts is sensitive to the  market  demand.  With  the  goods-market  approach  extending  to  multiple  goods,  the  strong implicit assumption is that the market demands for our basket software and our sample OSS are similar, so they lead to commensurate prices.\n\nAn alternative and even more simplified goods-market back-of-the-envelope calculation that does not account for lines of code and relies on no scaling from the labor market approach would simply be to multiply a price of a reference good with the usage. We can take the minimum, average, and maximum prices of the basket of proprietary goods as captured in the reference price vector p = (69.99, 1610.17, 5800) and simply multiply it with usage from the combined Census and BuiltWith sample (Table 1). Based on those imputed proprietary price assumptions, the goods market demand side value would range from $0.2 - $16.5 trillion (minimum price - maximum price)  with  the  mean  price  resulting  in  a  value  estimate  of  $4.5  trillion.  However,  while  this estimate creates slightly more variance than the labor market approach, it is inherently flawed by simply assuming that the imputed prices are identical for each open source product based on the reference price. We further think this very simple back-of-the-envelope is an orange to apples comparison since the goods in our basket are fully functional, stand-alone software packages, while the packages in the Census and BuiltWith datasets are comprised of application libraries, which are generally smaller than such stand-alone packages.\n\nGiven all the complexities and assumptions one has to make due to lack of data for a goodsmarket approach, we place stronger emphasis on the labor cost approach highlighted in the main body but we include this method here for completeness.\n\nDocument 11: ## 4. Results\n\nAfter applying the labor market approach using COCOMO II, we obtain global estimates for the value of OSS. To calculate the overall value, we first need the underlying number of lines of code (to calculate the supply-side value) and then the usage statistics (for the demand-side value). Since there may be substantial heterogeneity in value by programming languages, we also show the top programming languages during our investigation period in the year 2020, as discussed above.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"simple","seed_document_id":9,"topic":"Others"}}

The Census allows identification of OSS code in products created by firms, while BuiltWith identifies OSS code that consumers directly interact with through firm websites.","reference_context":"Document 7: ## 2. Empirical Setting and Data\n\nAlthough the concept of free and open software has existed since the 1950's, it became more popular in the 1980's due to the efforts of Richard Stallman and his launch of the GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation (Maracke, 2019). However, it was in the 1990's that OSS took off after Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel, a now widely adopted OSS operating system (Tozzi, 2016). Today, OSS is considered a key building block of the digital economy and is widely used by software developers in everything from phones to cars to refrigerators to cutting-edge AI (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021).\n\nWe use two complementary main data sources to estimate the value of OSS. The first is the Census and is inward facing. It allows us to identify OSS code that goes into products that firms create. The second dataset is BuiltWith and is outward facing, allowing us to identify OSS code  that  consumers  directly  interact  with  through  firm  websites.  Since  the  raw  data  in  both datasets only contains package names, version numbers, and package manager names, and does not  contain  any  source  code  related  information,  we  first  obtain  the  publicly  accessible  code repository for each package which includes package-level information including the lines of code and  the  programming  languages  used.  One  may  worry  about  double-counting  for  the  value calculations as a result of using two separate datasets. However, the overlap of both the Census and  the  BuiltWith  sample  is  very  small:  there  are  only  18  packages  found  in  both  datasets. Moreover, it is unlikely that double counting is a concern as the two datasets capture different dimensions of OSS usage: the Census captures packaged software whose usage is inward-facing while BuiltWith captures usage in websites that are outward-facing. Finally, as a supplementary\n\ndataset, we use GHTorrent, a detailed history of OSS-related activity on GitHub, the most popular OSS hosting platform and a commonly used data source for studies of OSS (e.g., Burton et al, 2017; Conti, Peukert, and Roche, 2023; Fackler, Hofmann, and Laurentsyeva, 2023; Kim, 2020; Tang, Wang, &amp; Tong, 2023). This detailed historical data allows us to go deeper into how the value  of  OSS  is  created  by  better  understanding  the  dispersion  of  the  contributions  across individual OSS developers. We describe the details of all three data sources and their preparation for estimation below.\n\nCensus. The  Census  II  of  Free  and  Open  Source  Software  (here:  Census)  was  jointly undertaken by the Linux Foundation and the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (Nagle et  al.,  2022). 1 The  Census  was  created  via  the  aggregation  of  data  from  three  major  software composition analysis (SCA) firms with thousands of clients across the globe. SCAs are hired to scan the codebase of a client and gather the OSS usage embedded in their proprietary software to ensure they are not violating any OSS license agreements.  Frequently this takes place as part of 2 the due diligence process related to mergers and acquisitions. Unlike other OSS demand measures available from public sources such as package download counts and code changes, the way this data was collected ensures that we observe the precise amount and type of internal OSS usage of the firms. In addition, it allows us to trace the dependencies each package relies on, so that we can observe the indirect OSS usage that is commonly hidden and difficult to obtain.  The result is over 3 2.7 million observations of OSS packages being used within products created by the SCA client firms for the calendar year 2020 (January 1 to December 31, 2020). 4\n\nThe Census project standardized package names based on the naming system of libraries.io -  a  widely  used  site  maintained  by  Tidelift  that  organizes  information  about  more  than  eight million open source packages. The Census focused on the top 2,000 packages based on usage\n\n1 The precise methodologies for the data collection and aggregation are detailed in the Census report by Nagle et al (2022).\n\n2 OSS usage licenses vary a great deal and while some licenses are very open and allow the code to be reused in any manner, including within proprietary code that will be made available for sale at a non-zero price, other licenses restrict reuse to only be allowed if the resultant code is released under the same OSS license (known as copyleft). A detailed discussion of OSS licenses can be found in Lerner and Tirole (2005) and Almeida et al (2017).\n\n3 Indirect OSS usage is captured by dependency analysis and is necessary to accurately measure the full breadth of the OSS a firm relies on. For example, if a firm's proprietary code calls OSS package A, but package A, in turn, calls package B, then only looking at the direct calls would miss that package B was a required building block for the firm's proprietary code.\n\n4 The Census defines an OSS package as 'a unit of software that can be installed and managed by a package manager,' and  defines  a  package  manager  as  'software  that  automates  the  process  of  installing  and  otherwise  managing packages' (Nagle et al, 2022).\n\nreported from the three of the most prominent SCA vendors to identify the most widely used OSS rather  than  the  long-tail  of  the  usage  distribution.  This  led  to  packages  with  less  than  five observations  of  usage  being  dropped.  Since  packages  written  in  the  JavaScript  programming language, and usually hosted on the Node Package Manager (NPM), are generally smaller (fewer lines  of  code)  than  packages  in  other  languages  and  therefore  frequently  have  higher  usage numbers (since developers must include many small packages instead of a few large packages), the Census separately selected the top 1,000 NPM packages and the top 1,000 non-NPM hosted packages.\n\nThis final dataset covers 70% of the total usage of OSS observed in the raw data of the census.   For  each  of  these  2,000  OSS  packages  in  the  Census,  we  identified  the  raw  code 5 maintained on GitHub, the most widely used platform for hosting OSS.  We first attempted to 6 obtain the GitHub repository uniform resource locator (URL) for each package from libraries.io. We were able to match 1,657 packages to repositories via this initial method.  For URLs without 7 a  matching  repository,  we  performed  Google  searches  loosely  following  the  method  in  Singh (2020). More specifically, for each unmatched package, we used the Google API to search for the package name and 'GitHub Repository' and treated the first GitHub repository URL in the results as  its  best  matched  GitHub  URL.   This  resulted  in  an  additional  174  packages  matched  to  a 8 repository. Finally, we manually searched for URLs for the remaining 169 packages to identify the relevant repository. This entire process resulted in matching 1,840 out of the 2,000 Census packages to a code repository with the raw source code for the package. The unmatched packages were determined to have been either removed from GitHub or became proprietary (and thus the original source code was no longer available) and hence, the manual search allowed us to drop\n\n5 The packages that made up the remaining 30% of the full Census data in the long-tail usage distribution were not shared in the final report and therefore cannot be included in our analysis.\n\n6 GitHub  is  a  hosting  and  collaboration  platform  that  contributors  can  use  to  coordinate  the  development  and distribution of OSS projects. Founded in 2008, GitHub has become the largest hub for OSS development in the world. In January 2023, GitHub had more than 370 million repositories and over 100 million developers. In addition to personal users, a wide range of private firms actively use the GitHub platform, including Microsoft (which bought GitHub in 2018), Facebook, Google, and numerous other small and large firms.\n\n7 We attempted to access all repository URLs obtained as a sanity check to ensure they are in working condition. For those we could not access on GitHub, we manually found the correct URLs.\n\n8 As a robustness check, we randomly selected 50 package-repository matches derived from the Google Search method and we checked them by hand. All matches were manually confirmed to be correct providing additional support for the automated matching method.\n\nthese 160 unmatched packages (less than 8% of the Census sample of 2,000) with high confidence from our analysis.\n\nBuiltWith. The BuiltWith data contains scans of all public websites across the globe and identifies the technologies they use. Unlike the inward facing Census data which focus on the usage of OSS, the BuiltWith data scan for the use of both proprietary and OSS in firm websites without explicit differentiation. To separate OSS from proprietary software in BuiltWith, we turn to the subset of all open source web development software in the technology category that includes \"JavaScript and its libraries,\" which generates 778 observations corresponding to the NPM OSS category  in  the  Census  data.  There  are  two  reasons  for  this  sampling  choice.  First,  this  given category is constructed by BuiltWith and we use it as a proxy for OSS to separate it from pecuniary software.  Second,  JavaScript,  one  of  the  core  technologies  for  building  websites,  is  the  most popular programming language by usage on GitHub (GitHub, 2022) and thus enables us to capture the most important OSS from the demand side perspective. The scans include 8.8 million unique websites and 72.8 million corresponding observations of OSS usage from January 1 to November 16, 2020. Further, to ensure that we measure the value of OSS usage generated by the private sector,  we  match  the  adopting  domains  of  the  JavaScript-related  OSS  from  BuiltWith  with company websites recorded in Orbis, Compustat, and PitchBook, three commonly used databases of corporate activity that capture registered businesses across the world. Performing this match ensures that OSS used by non-commercial websites (e.g., an individual person's personal website) is excluded in our analysis. This results in a match-rate of 38.6%, which corresponds to around 3.4 million websites of distinct firms.\n\nFor the BuiltWith data, we cannot employ the first method we use for the Census (using libraries.io to help identify the repository URL) since only the technology names associated with the  packages  were  provided  by  BuiltWith,  and  other  information  (e.g.,  package  and  package manager  names)  is  not  included. 9 Hence,  we  start  by  performing  the  Google  Search  method mentioned above which results in a match of 695 packages to repositories. We then manually searched the Github URLs for 83 of the remaining unmatched packages, resulting in an addition of 46 packages. In total, for the BuiltWith data we were able to identify 741 out of 778 package-\n\n9 Since the package and package manager names are missing, a precise match using libraries.io was not feasible. Technology names are product names intended for customers and can be less technical and precise than the package names for internal development purposes. Thus, using technology names in a libraries.io search could cause significant ambiguity.\n\nrepository matches. As with the Census data, the remaining 37 unmatched packages (less than 5%) are dropped from our analysis because they had been deleted from GitHub.\n\nGHTorrent database. To obtain measures of the dispersion of the OSS value creation, we utilize  the  GHTorrent  database,  which  contains  the  entire  activity  history  on  GitHub  using GitHub's Representational State Transfer (REST) application programming interface (API). We leveraged  its  records  of  GitHub  repositories,  developer-level  commits,  and  developer  public profile information to estimate the contribution of each developer. We narrowed the sample for our developer contribution analysis in two steps. First, we winnowed the GitHub repositories and their  commits  from  GHTorrent  based  on  the  repository  URLs  of  our  joint  Census-BuiltWith sample. 10 Second, we focus on human contributions to OSS by removing approximately eight thousand (12%) GitHub contributors that we considered to be robots. 11 The final sample contains around sixty thousand developers and 2.3 million commits.\n\nTo prepare these three datasets for estimation, we first identified the number of lines of code and the programming languages used for each package using the OSS packages pygount (to count  the  number  of  lines  of  code)  and  linguist  (to  identify  programming  languages). 12 We categorize each distinct language into one of three different buckets moving from more likely human-written to more likely machine-written (see Table A1). Bucket 1 contains programming and markup languages (which are most likely to be human-written), bucket 3 contains data (most likely to be machine-written), and bucket 2 contains anything in between, such as config files and batch processing (which are sometimes human-written and sometimes machine-written, but it is difficult to tell based purely on looking at the code). 13 For our primary estimation we only use bucket 1 while providing robustness checks for buckets 2 and 3 in the Appendix, and thus our results represent a lower bound. Finally, for some analyses we dig deeper and show the top 5 programming languages (as classified by GitHub, 2022 for the year 2020; the year our data is from). The top 5 programming languages contain C (including C# and C++), Java, JavaScript,\n\n10 The match rate is over 96%, with the unmatched repositories accounting for only 0.15% of our calculated OSS demand value discussed below.\n\n11 The filtering is based on the 'fake user' classification by GHTorrent, as well as any usernames containing words 'bot' or 'robot', surrounded by special characters. This method is more conservative than other methods of bot detection  like  that  used  in  the  GitHub  Innovation  Graph  (https:\/\/innovationgraph.github.com\/),  which  rely  on  a monthly commit frequency threshold.\n\n12 https:\/\/pypi.org\/project\/pygount\/ and https:\/\/github.com\/github-linguist\/linguist\n\n13 Note that our focus is the cost to recreate OSS code written by humans, not robots. However, directly removing all OSS contributions from robot accounts is infeasible here, because we cannot observe the exact lines of code written by the robot accounts on GitHub.\n\nPython, and Typescript. We also add Go to this list of top languages since it is an increasingly widely used language in OSS.\n\nDocument 16: ## 5. Conclusion\n\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith. We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average value and distributed it across industries.\n\nIn this study we estimate the value of widely-used open source software globally with two unique datasets: the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data. We are able to estimate not only the supply side value of existing code (e.g., the cost it would take to rewrite each piece of widely-used OSS once) but also the demand side value for the private economy (e.g., the cost it would take for each company that uses a piece of OSS to rewrite it). While we do not focus on the long tail of OSS, we consider this an additional contribution of our study as focusing on OSS that is widely used allows us to more precisely understand the value created by OSS, rather than only measuring the  replacement  cost  for  all  OSS  (which  would  overestimate  the  true  value  since  many  OSS projects are not used in production code). However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n\nAdjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.  We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves.  Over  95%  percent  of  the  demand-side  value  is  generated  by  only  five  percent  of programmers, and those programmers contribute not only to a few widely used projects but to substantially more projects than the programmers that are engaged at the lower end of the value distribution.\n\nIn aggregate, our results show the substantial value that OSS contributes to the economy despite this value generally showing up as zero via direct measurement since prices equal zero and quantity is difficult to measure using public data alone. Our research lays the groundwork for future studies of not only OSS, but of all IT and its growing impact on the global economy.\n\nDocument 6: ## 1. Introduction\n\nIn 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that 'software is eating the world' (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that 'open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,' (Jacks, 2022). Other recent studies have come to similar conclusions showing that open source software  (OSS)  -  software  whose  source  code  is  publicly  available  for  inspection,  use,  and modification and is often created in a decentralized manner and distributed for free - appears in 96% of codebases (Synopsys 2023), and that some commercial software consists of up to 99.9% freely available OSS (Musseau et al., 2022). Although in its early days OSS frequently copied features from existing proprietary software, OSS today includes cutting edge technology in various fields including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, big data, and analytics.  However, despite the increasing importance of OSS to all software (and therefore to the entire economy), measuring its impact has been elusive. Traditionally, to measure the value created by a good or service,  economists  multiply  the  price  ( p )  times  the  quantity  sold  ( q ).  However,  in  OSS, p is generally zero since the source code is publicly available, and q is  unknown due to the limited number of restrictions around how the code may be copied and reused. For example, if a company downloads  a  piece  of  OSS  from  a  public  code  repository,  it  may  copy  it  thousands  of  times internally (legally) and then share it with suppliers or customers (also legally), so public download data is insufficient. Although some recent studies have sought to estimate the value of p (discussed below), data for estimating q has been unavailable or intractable for anything more than just a handful of OSS packages. Using newly collected data from multiple sources, the goal of this paper is to provide estimates for both p and q and to use those to shine light on the question: What is the value of open source software?\n\nUnderstanding the value of OSS is of critical importance not only due to the role it plays in the economy, but also due to it being one of the most successful and impactful modern examples of the centuries old economic concept of 'the commons' which run the risk of meeting the fate known as 'the tragedy of the commons.' This concept can trace its roots as far back as the 4 th -century BC philosopher Aristotle who wrote 'That which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care. Men pay most attention to what is their own and care less for what is common.'  (Aristotle,  1981).  William  Forster  Lloyd  (1833)  resurfaced  the  idea  in  modern economic thought by highlighting the example of shared tracts of land used for cattle grazing by\n\nmultiple cattle herders who each had an incentive to overuse the shared resource. Garrett Hardin (1968)  brought  the  concept  into  the  broader  zeitgeist  when  he  wrote  an  article  discussing  the problem entitled 'The Tragedy of the Commons.' Building on this work, Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for her research highlighting paths to avoiding the tragedy of the commons through community coordination efforts that did not necessitate government enforced laws to manage and guard the commons (Ostrom 1990). The parallels between shared grazing lands and shared digital infrastructure are palpable - the availability of communal grass to feed cattle, and in turn feed people, was critical to the agrarian economy, and the ability to not have to recreate code that someone else has already written is critical to the modern economy. Further, in both contexts, despite knowing grass and code are critical inputs to the economy, measuring their actual value is difficult. And, as the renowned mathematician and physicist Lord Kelvin is believed to have said, 'If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.' And if you cannot improve and maintain it, such common goods may crumble under the weight of their own success as they are overused, but underinvested in (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021). Therefore, measuring the value OSS creates is crucial to the future health of the digital economy, and the rest of the economy that is built on top of it.\n\nImportantly, recent studies have attempted to address these measurement issues but fall short of capturing both the breadth and depth of OSS usage - a gap we seek to fill with this paper. For example, researchers have attempted to gain breadth by using novel methodologies to estimate the labor replacement value of the current corpus of OSS created in the United States at $38 billion in 2019 (Robbins et al., 2021) and that created in the European Union at €1 billion (Blind et al., 2021) by imputing the labor costs that it would have taken to rewrite existing OSS. Such efforts do a very good job at estimating what it would cost to replace all existing OSS if it disappeared tomorrow. However, the resultant estimates rely on two important assumptions. First, that all OSS is equally valuable from a usage standpoint, and second that the concept of OSS would still exist, and society would just need to rewrite the code once, thus addressing the aforementioned problem of a missing value for p , but not addressing the missing value of q . In a world where OSS did not exist at all, then each piece of OSS software would not need to be rewritten just once, but instead would need to be rewritten by every firm that used the software (assuming the firm could freely share the software within its boundaries). Other research (Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; MurcianoGoroff, Zhuo, and Greenstein, 2021) has gone deeper into this hypothetical, albeit in a narrow\n\nmanner, by only focusing on web servers (which are public facing on the Internet and can therefore be readily measured). Using different methods, both studies measure q for this one type of software and impute p by using a goods replacement value approach based on the prices for closed-source alternatives offered by firms. With data from the United States the resulting estimates show a value of  $2  billion  for  the  OSS  Apache  Web  Server  in  2012  (Greenstein  and  Nagle,  2014)  and  a combined value of $4.5 billion for Apache and the increasingly popular OSS web server nginx in 2018 (Murciano-Goroff, et al., 2021). However, although web servers are an important part of the OSS  ecosystem,  they  constitute  a  small  portion  of  it.  We  seek  to  build  upon  the  important contributions this existing research has made in an attempt to go both broad and deep to create a more complete measure of the value of OSS.\n\nTo consider the value of OSS in both a broad and deep manner, we use data from two primary sources that allow us to gain insights into the OSS used at tens of thousands of firms across the world. The first is the 'Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries' (Nagle et al., 2022). The Census II project utilized partnerships with multiple software composition analysis (SCA) firms to create various lists of the most widely used OSS. SCAs are hired to scan the codebases of a company to ensure they are not violating any OSS licenses and, as a byproduct, track all the OSS code used by their customers and the products they build. The Census II project aggregated data from multiple SCAs to build a dataset of OSS usage at tens of thousands of firms based  on  millions  of  data  points  (observations  of  OSS  usage).  The  second  data  source  is  the BuiltWith dataset, from which we leverage scans of nearly nine million websites to identify the underlying technology deployed by these websites, including OSS libraries. The BuiltWith data has been used in multiple academic studies (DeStefano &amp; Timmis 2023, Dushnitsky &amp; Stroube 2021, Koning et al.. 2022), but to our knowledge this is the first one to focus on OSS usage. The Census II data and the BuiltWith data are complementary as the former focuses on OSS that is built  into  the  software  a  company  sells,  while  the  latter  focuses  on  OSS  that  is  built  into  a company's website, thus reducing the chances of double-counting observations across the datasets. In aggregate, these two datasets combined create the most complete measurement of OSS usage ( q ) to date. Further, by focusing on OSS that is widely deployed and used by firms, rather than considering all the projects that exist in an OSS repository, we enhance the methodologies of prior studies by reducing the likelihood of measurement error stemming from projects that are posted as publicly available OSS but are not actually used in any practical manner. Not accounting for this\n\nmeasurement error would lead to overestimation of the actual value of OSS as projects that are widely used would be valued in the same way as projects that are not used at all.\n\nTo estimate p ,  we  follow  the  literature  discussed  above  and  use  the  labor  replacement value. First, we calculate the labor cost it would take an individual firm to recreate a given OSS package by measuring the number of lines of code within the package and then applying the Constructive Cost Model II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) - also known as COCOMO II to estimate the number of person-hours it would take to write the code from scratch. We then utilize global wage data from Salary Expert to get an accurate estimate of the labor costs a firm would incur if this piece of OSS did not exist. These costs can be combined with the q values from above at the OSS package level to estimate the combined value of all OSS from both the supply and demand sides.\n\nWe find a value ranging from $1.22 billion to $6.22 billion if we were to decide as a society to recreate all widely used OSS on the supply side. However, considering the actual usage of OSS leads to a demand-side value that is orders of magnitude larger and ranges from $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion, if each firm who used an OSS package had to recreate it from scratch (e.g., the concept of OSS did not exist). We document substantial heterogeneity of the value of OSS by programming  language  and  internal  vs  outward-facing  programming  efforts.  Further,  we  find considerable  heterogeneity  in  value  contributions  by  programmers  as  5%  of  programmers  are responsible for more than 90% of the value created on the supply- and demand- side. The data we use is arguably the most comprehensive source of data to measure the value created by firm usage of OSS at this time. However, as for any project, the evidence is not complete and we argue that we underestimate the value since our data, e.g., does not include operating systems, which are a substantial omitted category of OSS.\n\nThis study makes four important contributions to the academic literature, practitioners, and policy makers. First, it provides the most complete estimate of the value of widely used OSS to date  by  accounting  for  not  only  the  supply-side  of  OSS  (price  to  create  it),  but  also  for  the usage\/demand-side at a scale that has not been done before. While prior estimates of the value of OSS only went either broad (estimating the supply-side costs of a large swath of OSS) or deep (estimating the value created by one particular type of OSS), this study does both by using unique datasets that allow for a better understanding of the breadth and depth of OSS usage. Further, rather than measuring the value of all OSS, this study focuses on the value of OSS that is used by firms\n\nto create its products and websites, limiting the measurement error occurring in studies that are unable to account for which OSS is actually used in production. This contribution builds upon, and extends, important research (e.g., Blind et al., 2021; Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021; Robbins et al., 2021) that has sought to identify the value of this vital resource that contributes a great deal to the modern economy despite the difficulties measuring this contribution. In  doing  so,  it  adds  insights  to  a  long-running  discussion  related  to  the  impact  of  information technology (IT) on productivity (Brynjolfsson, 1993; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 1996; Nagle, 2019a; Solow, 1987) known as the 'productivity paradox' where IT investments can have limited impact on productivity statistics. This debate has continued into the emerging context of AI (Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson, 2018). Our work contributes to this conversation by highlighting a massive societal level cost-savings (and hence productivity enhancement) that is created by the existence of OSS.\n\nSecond, our research contributes methodological advances to the study of intangible capital by highlighting novel sources of data related to investments in OSS. Prior research has shown that intangible capital plays an increasingly important role in economic growth (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel,  2009)  and  firm  value  (Peters  and  Taylor,  2017),  but  it  often  goes  unmeasured  or misattributed (Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou, 2014). Further, we demonstrate how these data sources can be used to understand the true investments in software that a firm makes, and that which they would have to make if OSS did not exist.  This  is  valuable  as  investments  in  software  are  an increasingly important type of intangible capital that is driving innovation (Branstetter, Drev, and Kwon, 2019) and performance (Krishnan et al., 2000).\n\nThird, our results help highlight for firms and managers the importance of OSS to their production, and ideally add weight to arguments that users of OSS should not just free ride but also contribute to the creation and maintenance of OSS (e.g., Henkel, 2008; Nagle, 2018). Such contributions are a fraction of the costs that firms would incur if OSS did not exist and the active participation of OSS users in helping maintain the OSS they use is critical to the health and future well-being of the OSS ecosystem (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021; Zhang et al., 2019).\n\nFourth,  and  finally,  our  study  helps  inform  policymakers  who  have  recently  started  to understand  the  growing  importance  of  OSS  to  the  economy  and  taken  actions  to  support  the ecosystem (European Commission, 2020; Executive Order No. 14028, 2021). However, most of these efforts are related to securing the existing OSS ecosystem, which is quite important, but do\n\nnot go as far as supporting the creation of new OSS. Our results help shine light on the importance of OSS to the overall economy and add weight to calls for more societal support of this critical resource. Our results further show that the majority of the value created by OSS is created by a small  number  of  contributors.  Although  it  has  long  been  known  that  a  small  number  of  OSS contributors do most of the work, we add new insights that show this is even more true for the value creation of widely-used OSS projects and that societal support for these individuals is critical to the future success of OSS, and in turn, the economy.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the empirical setting and data. Section 3 discusses the methods including measurement challenges. In section 4, we estimate the value of open source software. Section 5 concludes.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"simple","seed_document_id":7,"topic":"Others"}}

A Lorenz curve that  lay  directly  on  the  45  degree  line  would  imply  a  very  even  distribution  of  values  across programmers. Instead, Panel A shows a Lorenz curve as a nearly flat line with a drastic increase for the final share of programmers. This implies that the distribution of the supply value is highly uneven and considerably more concentrated than the 80\/20 standard. Indeed, the last five percent of programmers, or 3,000 programmers, generate over 93% of the supply side value. Similarly, Panel B shows - when accounting for usage - that those last five percent generate over 96% of the demand side value.  In  aggregate,  this  indicates  that  a  very  small  number  of  programmers  are creating the bulk of OSS code that is heavily relied upon by firms to create their own code. In both Panel A and Panel B we can also see a rise in the number of repositories for the last 10-15% of programmers that contribute  to  the  highest  value,  which  implies  that  the  uneven  value  that  is generated by few programmers is not just due to a few highly valuable repositories but by the contributions of this handful of contributors to a substantial number of repositories.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"simple","seed_document_id":15,"topic":"Others"}}

Introduction\n\nIn 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that 'software is eating the world' (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that 'open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,' (Jacks, 2022). Other recent studies have come to similar conclusions showing that open source software  (OSS)  -  software  whose  source  code  is  publicly  available  for  inspection,  use,  and modification and is often created in a decentralized manner and distributed for free - appears in 96% of codebases (Synopsys 2023), and that some commercial software consists of up to 99.9% freely available OSS (Musseau et al., 2022). Although in its early days OSS frequently copied features from existing proprietary software, OSS today includes cutting edge technology in various fields including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, big data, and analytics.  However, despite the increasing importance of OSS to all software (and therefore to the entire economy), measuring its impact has been elusive. Traditionally, to measure the value created by a good or service,  economists  multiply  the  price  ( p )  times  the  quantity  sold  ( q ).  However,  in  OSS, p is generally zero since the source code is publicly available, and q is  unknown due to the limited number of restrictions around how the code may be copied and reused. For example, if a company downloads  a  piece  of  OSS  from  a  public  code  repository,  it  may  copy  it  thousands  of  times internally (legally) and then share it with suppliers or customers (also legally), so public download data is insufficient. Although some recent studies have sought to estimate the value of p (discussed below), data for estimating q has been unavailable or intractable for anything more than just a handful of OSS packages. Using newly collected data from multiple sources, the goal of this paper is to provide estimates for both p and q and to use those to shine light on the question: What is the value of open source software?\n\nUnderstanding the value of OSS is of critical importance not only due to the role it plays in the economy, but also due to it being one of the most successful and impactful modern examples of the centuries old economic concept of 'the commons' which run the risk of meeting the fate known as 'the tragedy of the commons.' This concept can trace its roots as far back as the 4 th -century BC philosopher Aristotle who wrote 'That which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care. Men pay most attention to what is their own and care less for what is common.'  (Aristotle,  1981).  William  Forster  Lloyd  (1833)  resurfaced  the  idea  in  modern economic thought by highlighting the example of shared tracts of land used for cattle grazing by\n\nmultiple cattle herders who each had an incentive to overuse the shared resource. Garrett Hardin (1968)  brought  the  concept  into  the  broader  zeitgeist  when  he  wrote  an  article  discussing  the problem entitled 'The Tragedy of the Commons.' Building on this work, Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for her research highlighting paths to avoiding the tragedy of the commons through community coordination efforts that did not necessitate government enforced laws to manage and guard the commons (Ostrom 1990). The parallels between shared grazing lands and shared digital infrastructure are palpable - the availability of communal grass to feed cattle, and in turn feed people, was critical to the agrarian economy, and the ability to not have to recreate code that someone else has already written is critical to the modern economy. Further, in both contexts, despite knowing grass and code are critical inputs to the economy, measuring their actual value is difficult. And, as the renowned mathematician and physicist Lord Kelvin is believed to have said, 'If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.' And if you cannot improve and maintain it, such common goods may crumble under the weight of their own success as they are overused, but underinvested in (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021). Therefore, measuring the value OSS creates is crucial to the future health of the digital economy, and the rest of the economy that is built on top of it.\n\nImportantly, recent studies have attempted to address these measurement issues but fall short of capturing both the breadth and depth of OSS usage - a gap we seek to fill with this paper. For example, researchers have attempted to gain breadth by using novel methodologies to estimate the labor replacement value of the current corpus of OSS created in the United States at $38 billion in 2019 (Robbins et al., 2021) and that created in the European Union at €1 billion (Blind et al., 2021) by imputing the labor costs that it would have taken to rewrite existing OSS. Such efforts do a very good job at estimating what it would cost to replace all existing OSS if it disappeared tomorrow. However, the resultant estimates rely on two important assumptions. First, that all OSS is equally valuable from a usage standpoint, and second that the concept of OSS would still exist, and society would just need to rewrite the code once, thus addressing the aforementioned problem of a missing value for p , but not addressing the missing value of q . In a world where OSS did not exist at all, then each piece of OSS software would not need to be rewritten just once, but instead would need to be rewritten by every firm that used the software (assuming the firm could freely share the software within its boundaries). Other research (Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; MurcianoGoroff, Zhuo, and Greenstein, 2021) has gone deeper into this hypothetical, albeit in a narrow\n\nmanner, by only focusing on web servers (which are public facing on the Internet and can therefore be readily measured). Using different methods, both studies measure q for this one type of software and impute p by using a goods replacement value approach based on the prices for closed-source alternatives offered by firms. With data from the United States the resulting estimates show a value of  $2  billion  for  the  OSS  Apache  Web  Server  in  2012  (Greenstein  and  Nagle,  2014)  and  a combined value of $4.5 billion for Apache and the increasingly popular OSS web server nginx in 2018 (Murciano-Goroff, et al., 2021). However, although web servers are an important part of the OSS  ecosystem,  they  constitute  a  small  portion  of  it.  We  seek  to  build  upon  the  important contributions this existing research has made in an attempt to go both broad and deep to create a more complete measure of the value of OSS.\n\nTo consider the value of OSS in both a broad and deep manner, we use data from two primary sources that allow us to gain insights into the OSS used at tens of thousands of firms across the world. The first is the 'Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries' (Nagle et al., 2022). The Census II project utilized partnerships with multiple software composition analysis (SCA) firms to create various lists of the most widely used OSS. SCAs are hired to scan the codebases of a company to ensure they are not violating any OSS licenses and, as a byproduct, track all the OSS code used by their customers and the products they build. The Census II project aggregated data from multiple SCAs to build a dataset of OSS usage at tens of thousands of firms based  on  millions  of  data  points  (observations  of  OSS  usage).  The  second  data  source  is  the BuiltWith dataset, from which we leverage scans of nearly nine million websites to identify the underlying technology deployed by these websites, including OSS libraries. The BuiltWith data has been used in multiple academic studies (DeStefano &amp; Timmis 2023, Dushnitsky &amp; Stroube 2021, Koning et al.. 2022), but to our knowledge this is the first one to focus on OSS usage. The Census II data and the BuiltWith data are complementary as the former focuses on OSS that is built  into  the  software  a  company  sells,  while  the  latter  focuses  on  OSS  that  is  built  into  a company's website, thus reducing the chances of double-counting observations across the datasets. In aggregate, these two datasets combined create the most complete measurement of OSS usage ( q ) to date. Further, by focusing on OSS that is widely deployed and used by firms, rather than considering all the projects that exist in an OSS repository, we enhance the methodologies of prior studies by reducing the likelihood of measurement error stemming from projects that are posted as publicly available OSS but are not actually used in any practical manner. Not accounting for this\n\nmeasurement error would lead to overestimation of the actual value of OSS as projects that are widely used would be valued in the same way as projects that are not used at all.\n\nTo estimate p ,  we  follow  the  literature  discussed  above  and  use  the  labor  replacement value. First, we calculate the labor cost it would take an individual firm to recreate a given OSS package by measuring the number of lines of code within the package and then applying the Constructive Cost Model II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) - also known as COCOMO II to estimate the number of person-hours it would take to write the code from scratch. We then utilize global wage data from Salary Expert to get an accurate estimate of the labor costs a firm would incur if this piece of OSS did not exist. These costs can be combined with the q values from above at the OSS package level to estimate the combined value of all OSS from both the supply and demand sides.\n\nWe find a value ranging from $1.22 billion to $6.22 billion if we were to decide as a society to recreate all widely used OSS on the supply side. However, considering the actual usage of OSS leads to a demand-side value that is orders of magnitude larger and ranges from $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion, if each firm who used an OSS package had to recreate it from scratch (e.g., the concept of OSS did not exist). We document substantial heterogeneity of the value of OSS by programming  language  and  internal  vs  outward-facing  programming  efforts.  Further,  we  find considerable  heterogeneity  in  value  contributions  by  programmers  as  5%  of  programmers  are responsible for more than 90% of the value created on the supply- and demand- side. The data we use is arguably the most comprehensive source of data to measure the value created by firm usage of OSS at this time. However, as for any project, the evidence is not complete and we argue that we underestimate the value since our data, e.g., does not include operating systems, which are a substantial omitted category of OSS.\n\nThis study makes four important contributions to the academic literature, practitioners, and policy makers. First, it provides the most complete estimate of the value of widely used OSS to date  by  accounting  for  not  only  the  supply-side  of  OSS  (price  to  create  it),  but  also  for  the usage\/demand-side at a scale that has not been done before. While prior estimates of the value of OSS only went either broad (estimating the supply-side costs of a large swath of OSS) or deep (estimating the value created by one particular type of OSS), this study does both by using unique datasets that allow for a better understanding of the breadth and depth of OSS usage. Further, rather than measuring the value of all OSS, this study focuses on the value of OSS that is used by firms\n\nto create its products and websites, limiting the measurement error occurring in studies that are unable to account for which OSS is actually used in production. This contribution builds upon, and extends, important research (e.g., Blind et al., 2021; Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021; Robbins et al., 2021) that has sought to identify the value of this vital resource that contributes a great deal to the modern economy despite the difficulties measuring this contribution. In  doing  so,  it  adds  insights  to  a  long-running  discussion  related  to  the  impact  of  information technology (IT) on productivity (Brynjolfsson, 1993; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 1996; Nagle, 2019a; Solow, 1987) known as the 'productivity paradox' where IT investments can have limited impact on productivity statistics. This debate has continued into the emerging context of AI (Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson, 2018). Our work contributes to this conversation by highlighting a massive societal level cost-savings (and hence productivity enhancement) that is created by the existence of OSS.\n\nSecond, our research contributes methodological advances to the study of intangible capital by highlighting novel sources of data related to investments in OSS. Prior research has shown that intangible capital plays an increasingly important role in economic growth (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel,  2009)  and  firm  value  (Peters  and  Taylor,  2017),  but  it  often  goes  unmeasured  or misattributed (Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou, 2014). Further, we demonstrate how these data sources can be used to understand the true investments in software that a firm makes, and that which they would have to make if OSS did not exist.  This  is  valuable  as  investments  in  software  are  an increasingly important type of intangible capital that is driving innovation (Branstetter, Drev, and Kwon, 2019) and performance (Krishnan et al., 2000).\n\nThird, our results help highlight for firms and managers the importance of OSS to their production, and ideally add weight to arguments that users of OSS should not just free ride but also contribute to the creation and maintenance of OSS (e.g., Henkel, 2008; Nagle, 2018). Such contributions are a fraction of the costs that firms would incur if OSS did not exist and the active participation of OSS users in helping maintain the OSS they use is critical to the health and future well-being of the OSS ecosystem (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021; Zhang et al., 2019).\n\nFourth,  and  finally,  our  study  helps  inform  policymakers  who  have  recently  started  to understand  the  growing  importance  of  OSS  to  the  economy  and  taken  actions  to  support  the ecosystem (European Commission, 2020; Executive Order No. 14028, 2021). However, most of these efforts are related to securing the existing OSS ecosystem, which is quite important, but do\n\nnot go as far as supporting the creation of new OSS. Our results help shine light on the importance of OSS to the overall economy and add weight to calls for more societal support of this critical resource. Our results further show that the majority of the value created by OSS is created by a small  number  of  contributors.  Although  it  has  long  been  known  that  a  small  number  of  OSS contributors do most of the work, we add new insights that show this is even more true for the value creation of widely-used OSS projects and that societal support for these individuals is critical to the future success of OSS, and in turn, the economy.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the empirical setting and data. Section 3 discusses the methods including measurement challenges. In section 4, we estimate the value of open source software.

{"id":"4739d463-4905-4bcd-9384-253d4561157d","question":"What is the goods-market valuation approach for estimating the value of OSS?","reference_answer":"The goods-market valuation approach estimates the value of OSS by considering the costs if all commercial users of the free OSS had to replace that software with pecuniary alternatives. It involves creating a basket of equivalent substitute proprietary goods priced on the open market as a stand-in for OSS products. This approach assumes a fixed price to sell a good multiple times, and the value is calculated by obtaining prices for each proprietary software equivalent and using the COCOMO labor market supply-side value for each OSS product as a proxy. The goods-market value is substantially smaller than the labor demand value because it assumes a firm produces the software once and sells it to many customers.","reference_context":"Document 21: ## Appendix A) Goods-Market Valuation Approach\n\nAs an alternate estimation method, instead of using the labor replacement cost, we use a goods replacement value approach. We identify several OSS packages that have similar closed-source, pecuniary alternatives and consider the costs if all commercial users of the free OSS had to replace that software with a pecuniary alternative (similar to the calculations Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) performed for web servers). We can then use this alternate value of p , combined with the q values from above to estimate a goods replacement value of OSS. This method builds on suggestions from Nordhaus (2006, p. 146) who says '…the price of market and nonmarket goods and services should be imputed on the basis of the comparable market goods and services.' We do not expect the estimates from the two methods to be similar. Quite the contrary, the value of those two methods varies substantially since the latter goods-market approach assumes a fixed price to sell a good multiple times and that fixed price is usually lower than the total value estimated from recreating all packages on the labor side. The differential between these estimates is  essentially the result of a firm stepping in to reproduce the missing OSS packages and then selling them for a pecuniary price rather than all firms needing to reproduce those packages from scratch themselves.\n\nWith the goods market approach, the thought experiment is still that we live in a world where OSS does not exist, but it has to be recreated via one firm that then charges a price for a good that is currently free. To value OSS via the goods market approach, we created a basket of equivalent substitute proprietary goods that are priced on the open market as a stand-in for an OSS product.  This  methodology  is  consistent  with  that  used  in  the  prior  literature  (Greenstein  and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021) although both of those studies only used a single good rather than a basket since they were focused on only one type of OSS (web servers). Since there is no readily available database for proprietary equivalents of OSS, we conduct a search based on subjective  perception  of  popularity  of  OSS  and  we  then  search  for  pecuniary,  closed-source substitutes for them. The resulting basket of 20 OSS packages with proprietary substitutes is a good representation of the diversity of OSS. The software ranges from media and design software to statistical analysis programs, to database management and web server software. 21\n\n21 Table A5 shows the basket of OSS and their proprietary equivalents that we used. To create this basket, we looked for proprietary software that had an OSS equivalent that was similar in its overall function and feature set, and sought to identify pairs of software that, in aggregate, captured a broad and representative set of the types of OSS that exist.\n\nBased on our OSS equivalent substitute proprietary goods basket we then obtain prices for each proprietary software equivalent and we calculated the COCOMO labor market supply-side value for each OSS product in the basket which we use as a proxy - for lack of the code from the proprietary software - for the COCOMO labor supply side value of the proprietary software (e.g., the cost it would take to pay a programmer to write that proprietary software from scratch). We then calculate the average COCOMO labor supply-side value of the basket, 𝑉 !,1#23.4 ,  and  the average price for the basket, 𝑃 !,1#23.4 . 22 Since, we know the labor market supply-side value of all OSS, 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; , we can setup the following equation and obtain the price of OSS, 𝑃 ! for the goodsmarket for all OSS via a simple scaling transformation:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nThis results in the following goods-market supply-side value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nWe can then obtain the equivalent demand-side goods-market values as follows:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nFrom the goods market side, we consider the equivalent price that a firm would charge if it produced all existing widely used OSS and then sold it as a product to customers.\n\nTable A6, column 3 shows that the value on the demand side ranges between $177 million and $244 million across the different buckets independent of the country of origin from which programmers are hired. Naturally, the goods-market value will be substantially smaller than the labor demand value since this imaginary firm will make a profit at a comparatively low price by producing the software once and then selling it to many customers. Further, while Greenstein and Nagle (2014) as well as Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) focus on one particular type of software only (web servers), we attempt to expand on their approach to many goods. However, the data limitations become a stronger constraint in this context which makes it inherently more difficult\n\n22 We obtained the average price of the goods-market proprietary basket by using a 3 years lifespan of software, i.e. 1\/(1-0.66), so the depreciation factor is 0.33. This is consistent with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules for depreciating software, which states 'If you can depreciate the cost of computer software, use the straight line method over a useful life of 36 months.' https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/publications\/p946#en\\_US\\_2022\\_publink1000107354.\n\nto  estimate  the  value  through  this  approach  while  requiring  substantially  more  assumptions. Instead of a pure goods-market approach, this requires assistance from the labor-market approach in terms of scaling for the estimate, which ultimately leads to a substantial underestimate of the value of OSS. Further, the pricing strategy of the proprietary software counterparts is sensitive to the  market  demand.  With  the  goods-market  approach  extending  to  multiple  goods,  the  strong implicit assumption is that the market demands for our basket software and our sample OSS are similar, so they lead to commensurate prices.\n\nAn alternative and even more simplified goods-market back-of-the-envelope calculation that does not account for lines of code and relies on no scaling from the labor market approach would simply be to multiply a price of a reference good with the usage. We can take the minimum, average, and maximum prices of the basket of proprietary goods as captured in the reference price vector p = (69.99, 1610.17, 5800) and simply multiply it with usage from the combined Census and BuiltWith sample (Table 1). Based on those imputed proprietary price assumptions, the goods market demand side value would range from $0.2 - $16.5 trillion (minimum price - maximum price)  with  the  mean  price  resulting  in  a  value  estimate  of  $4.5  trillion.  However,  while  this estimate creates slightly more variance than the labor market approach, it is inherently flawed by simply assuming that the imputed prices are identical for each open source product based on the reference price. We further think this very simple back-of-the-envelope is an orange to apples comparison since the goods in our basket are fully functional, stand-alone software packages, while the packages in the Census and BuiltWith datasets are comprised of application libraries, which are generally smaller than such stand-alone packages.\n\nGiven all the complexities and assumptions one has to make due to lack of data for a goodsmarket approach, we place stronger emphasis on the labor cost approach highlighted in the main body but we include this method here for completeness.\n\nDocument 9: ## 3.1 Labor market approach\n\nFor the labor market approach, we estimate the value of OSS by calculating the replacement value of a package. We ask how much it would cost to reproduce the package by hiring a programmer and paying them a competitive market wage. To estimate this supply-side value ( 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; ) , we take the complete list of OSS packages discussed above, and then count the lines of code in each unique\n\n14 In an alternative version, we use a mixture of a labor and goods market approach that is more closely aligned with Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff, et al (2021). However, applying this method in our setting requires numerous additional assumptions due to data constraints. For simplicity we call it the goods market approach for which we provide the details and statistics, as well as the limitations in Appendix A.\n\npackage. 15 For each unique package,  , we calculate the value and then sum over all these values i to obtain the total value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nIn this calculation, we implicitly do not incorporate any production externalities since we assume that there is no spillover knowledge from one package to the next that would lower the cost of programming. 16 This methodology is similar to that used by other papers that estimate the supply-side costs of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021).\n\nWe then calculate the demand-side value of OSS by incorporating the usage information ( Q) for each package:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nHere, we do not incorporate consumption externalities, i.e., we do not allow a benefit to arise for the general public when a package has been created and we further make sure that each firm is only replacing a package they use once, since a replaced package can be used within a firm as a club good (e.g., see Cornes and Sandler, 1996). The value 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost to rewrite all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the concept of OSS still exists, but all of these packages needed to be rewritten from scratch), while the value 𝑉 + \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost for each firm that uses one of these OSS packages to pay a developer to rewrite those packages (e.g., OSS itself no longer exists).\n\nFor both the supply and demand models, we obtain the dollar-value for each package ( 𝑃 ( ) via the Constructive Cost Model II, also abbreviated as COCOMO II (Boehm 1984, Boehm et al. 2009). The model has previously been used by the United States Department of Defense to estimate software project costs as well as in prior research estimating the value of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021). It is a highly flexible model that allows us to create non-linear transformations of lines of code to dollar-values. It uses the following modelling equation:\n\n15 We use only the pure lines of code excluding documentation lines and empty lines. Hence, we underestimate the true value of recreating each package.\n\n16 Similar to a representative agent model (e.g. see Williamson 2006), one may think of each package being reproduced by separate programmers who are identical replicas of each other (and therefore have the same skill level, but do not become more efficient via learning).\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n( (\n\nwhere 𝐿 represents the lines of codes in thousands and E the effort in person-month units for each project  . Consistent with Blind et al. (2021), we use the default parameter values for i 𝛼 , 𝛽 and 𝜂. The parameters 𝛼 𝛽 , are non-linear adjustment factors set to 2.94, and 1.0997 respectively . The parameter 𝜂 is an effort-adjustment factor which can be modified to incorporate subjective assessments of product, hardware, personnel, and project attributes. Since we do not have a prior for each project, we set 𝜂 to the default value of one. To obtain the price ( 𝑃 ( ) of each OSS project, we  then  multiply  the  results  of  equation  (3)  by  the  weighted  global  wage  that  an  average programmer would obtain on the open market. To calculate a global wage, we include the base monthly salaries of software developers from Salary Expert for the top 30 countries in terms of their GitHub developer counts in 2021 (Wachs et al., 2022). 17 The weight of each country is its share of active GitHub contributors over the total contributors in the top 30 countries. We further create bounds by using a low-wage (India) and high-wage (USA) labor market for the wage to better understand how the value would vary by the pool of programmers used to recreate all of OSS. 18\n\nDocument 8: ## 3. Methodology\n\nWe first measure the value of OSS by considering the supply and the demand side of OSS using a labor market approach. 14 The thought experiment is that we live in a world where OSS does not exist and has to be recreated at each firm that uses a given piece of OSS. Using the labor market approach, we calculate the labor replacement cost of each OSS package. To estimate the value for each package, we use COCOMO II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) at the individual package level and then sum across all package values to obtain a supply-side labor market replacement value. Then, we scale the supply-side value by the number of times firms are using each package while removing multi-usage within each firm to obtain a demand-side value.\n\nSecond, we move beyond the aggregate and inspect inequality in the value creation process. In OSS, as with many creative endeavors, it is common that a small handful of individuals provide the bulk of the contributions, while many others make small contributions (sometimes referred to as the 80\/20 rule, implying 80% of the work is done by 20% of the people). Research has shown these frequent contributors often attain positions of influence in OSS communities as a result of their efforts (Hanisch, et al, 2018). Therefore, to better understand the dispersion of value creation across developers, we first use the GHTorrent data and identify individual developer contributions in two ways: a) through their OSS value contributions directly and b) through the total number of repositories they contributed to. We then test how concentrated these two contribution measures are to better understand whether many or few developers contribute to the total value we measure. We explain the exact details for the labor market approach and the inequality of valuations below.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"simple","seed_document_id":21,"topic":"Others"}}

Conclusion\n\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith. We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average value and distributed it across industries.\n\nIn this study we estimate the value of widely-used open source software globally with two unique datasets: the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data. We are able to estimate not only the supply side value of existing code (e.g., the cost it would take to rewrite each piece of widely-used OSS once) but also the demand side value for the private economy (e.g., the cost it would take for each company that uses a piece of OSS to rewrite it). While we do not focus on the long tail of OSS, we consider this an additional contribution of our study as focusing on OSS that is widely used allows us to more precisely understand the value created by OSS, rather than only measuring the  replacement  cost  for  all  OSS  (which  would  overestimate  the  true  value  since  many  OSS projects are not used in production code). However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n\nAdjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.  We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves.  Over  95%  percent  of  the  demand-side  value  is  generated  by  only  five  percent  of programmers, and those programmers contribute not only to a few widely used projects but to substantially more projects than the programmers that are engaged at the lower end of the value distribution.\n\nIn aggregate, our results show the substantial value that OSS contributes to the economy despite this value generally showing up as zero via direct measurement since prices equal zero and quantity is difficult to measure using public data alone. Our research lays the groundwork for future studies of not only OSS, but of all IT and its growing impact on the global economy.\n\nDocument 14: ## --- Figure 2 about here ---\n\nFigure 2 splits the OSS value estimates for each language by our inward facing (Census) and outward facing (BuiltWith) data sources. Panel A and Panel B focus on the supply and demand side estimation for the Census. We obtain a similar pattern that has been established already in the aggregate when pooling both data sources (Figure 1) albeit the impact of JavaScript is substantially lower.  On  the  supply  side  of  the  Census  in  Panel  A,  Java  has  the  second-highest  value  while JavaScript  code  from  the  Census  contributes  to  a  substantially  lower  value  to  the  aggregate. Similarly, the supply side values of C, Python, and Typescript are mainly driven by the Census. From the demand side Panel B we find that Go is the most popular language for inward facing code while all other languages appear to be negligible in relative terms.\n\nFigure 2, Panel C and Panel D show the supply and demand side values for the BuiltWith dataset. The supply side value in Panel C clearly indicates that the value from the BuiltWith sample is driven by JavaScript code, which is a good sanity check since we focused on JavaScript packages to proxy for OSS in the BuiltWith sample, as discussed above. The second highest value is created by TypeScript which is reassuring since it is a superset of JavaScript. Panel D shows a similar pattern  on  the  usage  side  where  most  of  the  value  arises  from  JavaScript  while  TypeScript  is trailing at the second spot as well. The other languages contribute only marginal amounts to the supply and demand side values. Overall, these findings are broadly consistent with the main use cases of the various languages (web programming vs. application programming) and an idea that languages through which value are generated are not necessarily identical to languages that are used by the general public.\n\n--- Figure 3 about here ---\n\nFigure 3 shows the demand-side value of OSS across industries by NAICS 2-digit codes using the BuiltWith online data. 20 This can be interpreted as the value each of these industries receive because OSS exists. The industry with the highest usage value of around $43 billion is 'Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.' 'Retail Trade' as well as 'Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services' make up another large part of the demand-side externally facing value of OSS with $36 billion and $35 billion, respectively. In contrast, industries that constitute just a small portion of the value are 'Mining, Quarrying, and Oil  and  Gas  Extraction',  'Utilities',  'Agriculture,  Forestry,  Fishing,  and  Hunting.'  The  latter industries are classical non-service sector industries and as such software is expected to play less of a role there.\n\nDocument 12: ## --- Table 1 about here ---\n\nTable  1  shows  descriptive  statistics  from  both  data  sets  separately.  The  inward-facing Census  (Panel  A)  contains  just  over  261.7  million  lines  of  code  with  72%  of  the  lines  being attributable to the top programming languages. The average package includes 142 thousand lines of code with a slightly lower average of 113 thousand lines of code for the subset of top languages. When considering the demand (usage) side, we observe that the Census packages were used over 2.7 million times while 92% of this usage is attributable to the top languages. The average package was used 1,472.4 times with a higher usage of around 1,497.5 for the top  languages.  For  the outward-facing  BuiltWith  data  we  find  similar  patterns,  but  at  different  levels.  The  packages included from BuiltWith include over 82 million lines of code, 71% of which are attributable to the  top  programming  languages.  The  average  package  within  the  BuiltWith  sample  has  111 thousand  lines  of  code  with  a  lower  average  of  around  80  thousand  lines  of  code  for  the  top languages. This is because our BuiltWith data primarily consists of JavaScript-based packages, which are often smaller than packages written in other languages. BuiltWith packages were used over 142 thousand times where 99.97% were attributable to the top languages. Next, we used these raw observations to calculate the value of all OSS through the labor market approach and estimated the value created from the supply and demand side.\n\n--- Table 2 about here ---\n\nTable 2 shows the estimates for the value of OSS based on the firm-relevant joint Census and BuiltWith sample. All estimates in Table 2 are based only on software languages classified in bucket  1  from  Table  A1,  which  are  the  most  likely  to  be  written  by  a  human  rather  than  a machine. 19 The first column contains estimates with wages from a low income country (India), the global  average  wage,  and  a  high  income  country  (United  States  of  America),  respectively  (as described above). To reproduce all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the idea of OSS still exists, but all current OSS is deleted and needs to be coded from scratch), using programmers at the average developer wage from India, it would require an investment of $1.22 billion. In contrast, if we use the average developer wage from the United States, then reproducing all widely-used OSS would require  an  investment  of  $6.22  billion.  Using  a  pool  of  programmers  from  across  the  world, weighed based on the existing geographic contributions to OSS as discussed above, would lead to an investment somewhere in between the low and high-income country, $4.15 billion. It is useful to compare these numbers to those from similar studies to understand differences in valuing all OSS (prior studies) versus that which is widely used (our study). Robbins et al. (2021) and Blind et al. (2021) use a method similar to ours and estimate that the value of OSS created in the US is $38 billion in 2019 and that created in the EU is €1 billion in 2018. Wachs et al. (2022) show that roughly 50% of OSS contributions come from the US and EU combined. In aggregate, that would lead these studies to give a global value of OSS of $78 billion. Thus, our middle estimate of a supply-side value of $4.15 billion for only firm-oriented and widely used OSS is a credible lowerbound and highlights the higher estimations of the total of supply-side value of OSS when not considering whether or not a given OSS package is widely used. This further indicates that the supply-side value of the most widely used OSS is roughly 5.5% of the supply-side value of all OSS.\n\nThe second column in Table 2 contains the demand side estimates based on the labor market approach. We find that if firms had to recreate all OSS packages they used (e.g., OSS itself no longer existed and every firm that used an OSS package had to recreate it), then the entire cost would amount to between $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion using labor from the low wage or high wage country only, respectively. A pool of programmers across the globe could recreate all of OSS that is being widely used for a cost of approximately $8.80 trillion. Interpreting this number is\n\n19 Tables in the appendix show the equivalent values from Table 2 when including software language buckets 1 and 2 (Table A3) and all three software language buckets (Table A4).\n\nslightly more complicated but still feasible. According to a Statista (2023) report, global software revenue in 2020 (the same year as our data) was $531.7 billion. However, this represents a flow, not a stock, of software. Relying on government estimates that software fully depreciates over three years, we can do a back of the envelope calculation and consider the purchase value of the full stock of prepackaged software used in 2020 as the aggregate of that sold from 2018 to 2020, which is $1.54 trillion. Further, this represents only the expenditure on prepackaged software and does  not  include  custom  purchased  or  in-house  developed  software.  Here,  the  best  obtainable estimates of private-sector investment in software overall come from the United States National Income and Product Accounts data (NIPA 2023). In 2020, the national account data shows that in the  US,  private  firms  spent  $479.2  billion  on  software,  of  which  45%  ($215.5  billion)  was prepackaged. If we assume this is a consistent ratio for the rest of the world, then the total amount firms spent on software being used in 2020 was $3.4 trillion (= $1.54 trillion\/0.45). Combining this rough estimate with the demand side estimate of the value of OSS based on an average global wage ($8.8 trillion), this indicates firms would spend $12.2 trillion (=$3.4 trillion + $8.8 trillion), or three and a half times what they currently spend if they needed to pay in-house developers to write the OSS that they currently use for free.\n\nDocument 6: ## 1. Introduction\n\nIn 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that 'software is eating the world' (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that 'open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,' (Jacks, 2022). Other recent studies have come to similar conclusions showing that open source software  (OSS)  -  software  whose  source  code  is  publicly  available  for  inspection,  use,  and modification and is often created in a decentralized manner and distributed for free - appears in 96% of codebases (Synopsys 2023), and that some commercial software consists of up to 99.9% freely available OSS (Musseau et al., 2022). Although in its early days OSS frequently copied features from existing proprietary software, OSS today includes cutting edge technology in various fields including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, big data, and analytics.  However, despite the increasing importance of OSS to all software (and therefore to the entire economy), measuring its impact has been elusive. Traditionally, to measure the value created by a good or service,  economists  multiply  the  price  ( p )  times  the  quantity  sold  ( q ).  However,  in  OSS, p is generally zero since the source code is publicly available, and q is  unknown due to the limited number of restrictions around how the code may be copied and reused. For example, if a company downloads  a  piece  of  OSS  from  a  public  code  repository,  it  may  copy  it  thousands  of  times internally (legally) and then share it with suppliers or customers (also legally), so public download data is insufficient. Although some recent studies have sought to estimate the value of p (discussed below), data for estimating q has been unavailable or intractable for anything more than just a handful of OSS packages. Using newly collected data from multiple sources, the goal of this paper is to provide estimates for both p and q and to use those to shine light on the question: What is the value of open source software?\n\nUnderstanding the value of OSS is of critical importance not only due to the role it plays in the economy, but also due to it being one of the most successful and impactful modern examples of the centuries old economic concept of 'the commons' which run the risk of meeting the fate known as 'the tragedy of the commons.' This concept can trace its roots as far back as the 4 th -century BC philosopher Aristotle who wrote 'That which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care. Men pay most attention to what is their own and care less for what is common.'  (Aristotle,  1981).  William  Forster  Lloyd  (1833)  resurfaced  the  idea  in  modern economic thought by highlighting the example of shared tracts of land used for cattle grazing by\n\nmultiple cattle herders who each had an incentive to overuse the shared resource. Garrett Hardin (1968)  brought  the  concept  into  the  broader  zeitgeist  when  he  wrote  an  article  discussing  the problem entitled 'The Tragedy of the Commons.' Building on this work, Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for her research highlighting paths to avoiding the tragedy of the commons through community coordination efforts that did not necessitate government enforced laws to manage and guard the commons (Ostrom 1990). The parallels between shared grazing lands and shared digital infrastructure are palpable - the availability of communal grass to feed cattle, and in turn feed people, was critical to the agrarian economy, and the ability to not have to recreate code that someone else has already written is critical to the modern economy. Further, in both contexts, despite knowing grass and code are critical inputs to the economy, measuring their actual value is difficult. And, as the renowned mathematician and physicist Lord Kelvin is believed to have said, 'If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.' And if you cannot improve and maintain it, such common goods may crumble under the weight of their own success as they are overused, but underinvested in (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021). Therefore, measuring the value OSS creates is crucial to the future health of the digital economy, and the rest of the economy that is built on top of it.\n\nImportantly, recent studies have attempted to address these measurement issues but fall short of capturing both the breadth and depth of OSS usage - a gap we seek to fill with this paper. For example, researchers have attempted to gain breadth by using novel methodologies to estimate the labor replacement value of the current corpus of OSS created in the United States at $38 billion in 2019 (Robbins et al., 2021) and that created in the European Union at €1 billion (Blind et al., 2021) by imputing the labor costs that it would have taken to rewrite existing OSS. Such efforts do a very good job at estimating what it would cost to replace all existing OSS if it disappeared tomorrow. However, the resultant estimates rely on two important assumptions. First, that all OSS is equally valuable from a usage standpoint, and second that the concept of OSS would still exist, and society would just need to rewrite the code once, thus addressing the aforementioned problem of a missing value for p , but not addressing the missing value of q . In a world where OSS did not exist at all, then each piece of OSS software would not need to be rewritten just once, but instead would need to be rewritten by every firm that used the software (assuming the firm could freely share the software within its boundaries). Other research (Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; MurcianoGoroff, Zhuo, and Greenstein, 2021) has gone deeper into this hypothetical, albeit in a narrow\n\nmanner, by only focusing on web servers (which are public facing on the Internet and can therefore be readily measured). Using different methods, both studies measure q for this one type of software and impute p by using a goods replacement value approach based on the prices for closed-source alternatives offered by firms. With data from the United States the resulting estimates show a value of  $2  billion  for  the  OSS  Apache  Web  Server  in  2012  (Greenstein  and  Nagle,  2014)  and  a combined value of $4.5 billion for Apache and the increasingly popular OSS web server nginx in 2018 (Murciano-Goroff, et al., 2021). However, although web servers are an important part of the OSS  ecosystem,  they  constitute  a  small  portion  of  it.  We  seek  to  build  upon  the  important contributions this existing research has made in an attempt to go both broad and deep to create a more complete measure of the value of OSS.\n\nTo consider the value of OSS in both a broad and deep manner, we use data from two primary sources that allow us to gain insights into the OSS used at tens of thousands of firms across the world. The first is the 'Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries' (Nagle et al., 2022). The Census II project utilized partnerships with multiple software composition analysis (SCA) firms to create various lists of the most widely used OSS. SCAs are hired to scan the codebases of a company to ensure they are not violating any OSS licenses and, as a byproduct, track all the OSS code used by their customers and the products they build. The Census II project aggregated data from multiple SCAs to build a dataset of OSS usage at tens of thousands of firms based  on  millions  of  data  points  (observations  of  OSS  usage).  The  second  data  source  is  the BuiltWith dataset, from which we leverage scans of nearly nine million websites to identify the underlying technology deployed by these websites, including OSS libraries. The BuiltWith data has been used in multiple academic studies (DeStefano &amp; Timmis 2023, Dushnitsky &amp; Stroube 2021, Koning et al.. 2022), but to our knowledge this is the first one to focus on OSS usage. The Census II data and the BuiltWith data are complementary as the former focuses on OSS that is built  into  the  software  a  company  sells,  while  the  latter  focuses  on  OSS  that  is  built  into  a company's website, thus reducing the chances of double-counting observations across the datasets. In aggregate, these two datasets combined create the most complete measurement of OSS usage ( q ) to date. Further, by focusing on OSS that is widely deployed and used by firms, rather than considering all the projects that exist in an OSS repository, we enhance the methodologies of prior studies by reducing the likelihood of measurement error stemming from projects that are posted as publicly available OSS but are not actually used in any practical manner. Not accounting for this\n\nmeasurement error would lead to overestimation of the actual value of OSS as projects that are widely used would be valued in the same way as projects that are not used at all.\n\nTo estimate p ,  we  follow  the  literature  discussed  above  and  use  the  labor  replacement value. First, we calculate the labor cost it would take an individual firm to recreate a given OSS package by measuring the number of lines of code within the package and then applying the Constructive Cost Model II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) - also known as COCOMO II to estimate the number of person-hours it would take to write the code from scratch. We then utilize global wage data from Salary Expert to get an accurate estimate of the labor costs a firm would incur if this piece of OSS did not exist. These costs can be combined with the q values from above at the OSS package level to estimate the combined value of all OSS from both the supply and demand sides.\n\nWe find a value ranging from $1.22 billion to $6.22 billion if we were to decide as a society to recreate all widely used OSS on the supply side. However, considering the actual usage of OSS leads to a demand-side value that is orders of magnitude larger and ranges from $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion, if each firm who used an OSS package had to recreate it from scratch (e.g., the concept of OSS did not exist). We document substantial heterogeneity of the value of OSS by programming  language  and  internal  vs  outward-facing  programming  efforts.  Further,  we  find considerable  heterogeneity  in  value  contributions  by  programmers  as  5%  of  programmers  are responsible for more than 90% of the value created on the supply- and demand- side. The data we use is arguably the most comprehensive source of data to measure the value created by firm usage of OSS at this time. However, as for any project, the evidence is not complete and we argue that we underestimate the value since our data, e.g., does not include operating systems, which are a substantial omitted category of OSS.\n\nThis study makes four important contributions to the academic literature, practitioners, and policy makers. First, it provides the most complete estimate of the value of widely used OSS to date  by  accounting  for  not  only  the  supply-side  of  OSS  (price  to  create  it),  but  also  for  the usage\/demand-side at a scale that has not been done before. While prior estimates of the value of OSS only went either broad (estimating the supply-side costs of a large swath of OSS) or deep (estimating the value created by one particular type of OSS), this study does both by using unique datasets that allow for a better understanding of the breadth and depth of OSS usage. Further, rather than measuring the value of all OSS, this study focuses on the value of OSS that is used by firms\n\nto create its products and websites, limiting the measurement error occurring in studies that are unable to account for which OSS is actually used in production. This contribution builds upon, and extends, important research (e.g., Blind et al., 2021; Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021; Robbins et al., 2021) that has sought to identify the value of this vital resource that contributes a great deal to the modern economy despite the difficulties measuring this contribution. In  doing  so,  it  adds  insights  to  a  long-running  discussion  related  to  the  impact  of  information technology (IT) on productivity (Brynjolfsson, 1993; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 1996; Nagle, 2019a; Solow, 1987) known as the 'productivity paradox' where IT investments can have limited impact on productivity statistics. This debate has continued into the emerging context of AI (Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson, 2018). Our work contributes to this conversation by highlighting a massive societal level cost-savings (and hence productivity enhancement) that is created by the existence of OSS.\n\nSecond, our research contributes methodological advances to the study of intangible capital by highlighting novel sources of data related to investments in OSS. Prior research has shown that intangible capital plays an increasingly important role in economic growth (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel,  2009)  and  firm  value  (Peters  and  Taylor,  2017),  but  it  often  goes  unmeasured  or misattributed (Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou, 2014). Further, we demonstrate how these data sources can be used to understand the true investments in software that a firm makes, and that which they would have to make if OSS did not exist.  This  is  valuable  as  investments  in  software  are  an increasingly important type of intangible capital that is driving innovation (Branstetter, Drev, and Kwon, 2019) and performance (Krishnan et al., 2000).\n\nThird, our results help highlight for firms and managers the importance of OSS to their production, and ideally add weight to arguments that users of OSS should not just free ride but also contribute to the creation and maintenance of OSS (e.g., Henkel, 2008; Nagle, 2018). Such contributions are a fraction of the costs that firms would incur if OSS did not exist and the active participation of OSS users in helping maintain the OSS they use is critical to the health and future well-being of the OSS ecosystem (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021; Zhang et al., 2019).\n\nFourth,  and  finally,  our  study  helps  inform  policymakers  who  have  recently  started  to understand  the  growing  importance  of  OSS  to  the  economy  and  taken  actions  to  support  the ecosystem (European Commission, 2020; Executive Order No. 14028, 2021). However, most of these efforts are related to securing the existing OSS ecosystem, which is quite important, but do\n\nnot go as far as supporting the creation of new OSS. Our results help shine light on the importance of OSS to the overall economy and add weight to calls for more societal support of this critical resource. Our results further show that the majority of the value created by OSS is created by a small  number  of  contributors.  Although  it  has  long  been  known  that  a  small  number  of  OSS contributors do most of the work, we add new insights that show this is even more true for the value creation of widely-used OSS projects and that societal support for these individuals is critical to the future success of OSS, and in turn, the economy.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the empirical setting and data. Section 3 discusses the methods including measurement challenges. In section 4, we estimate the value of open source software.

Panel A and Panel B focus on the supply and demand side estimation for the Census. We obtain a similar pattern that has been established already in the aggregate when pooling both data sources (Figure 1) albeit the impact of JavaScript is substantially lower.  On  the  supply  side  of  the  Census  in  Panel  A,  Java  has  the  second-highest  value  while JavaScript  code  from  the  Census  contributes  to  a  substantially  lower  value  to  the  aggregate. Similarly, the supply side values of C, Python, and Typescript are mainly driven by the Census. From the demand side Panel B we find that Go is the most popular language for inward facing code while all other languages appear to be negligible in relative terms.\n\nFigure 2, Panel C and Panel D show the supply and demand side values for the BuiltWith dataset. The supply side value in Panel C clearly indicates that the value from the BuiltWith sample is driven by JavaScript code, which is a good sanity check since we focused on JavaScript packages to proxy for OSS in the BuiltWith sample, as discussed above. The second highest value is created by TypeScript which is reassuring since it is a superset of JavaScript. Panel D shows a similar pattern  on  the  usage  side  where  most  of  the  value  arises  from  JavaScript  while  TypeScript  is trailing at the second spot as well. The other languages contribute only marginal amounts to the supply and demand side values. Overall, these findings are broadly consistent with the main use cases of the various languages (web programming vs. application programming) and an idea that languages through which value are generated are not necessarily identical to languages that are used by the general public.\n\n--- Figure 3 about here ---\n\nFigure 3 shows the demand-side value of OSS across industries by NAICS 2-digit codes using the BuiltWith online data. 20 This can be interpreted as the value each of these industries receive because OSS exists. The industry with the highest usage value of around $43 billion is 'Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.' 'Retail Trade' as well as 'Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services' make up another large part of the demand-side externally facing value of OSS with $36 billion and $35 billion, respectively. In contrast, industries that constitute just a small portion of the value are 'Mining, Quarrying, and Oil  and  Gas  Extraction',  'Utilities',  'Agriculture,  Forestry,  Fishing,  and  Hunting.'  The  latter industries are classical non-service sector industries and as such software is expected to play less of a role there.\n\nDocument 13: ## --- Figure 1 about here ---\n\nFigure 1 shows the heterogeneity of the value of OSS across the top programming languages. Panel A shows the supply side value with the labor value being displayed on the vertical axis. We find that OSS packages created in Go have the highest value with $803 million in value that would have to be created from scratch if the OSS packages did not exist. Go is closely followed by JavaScript  and  Java  with  $758  million  and  $658  million,  respectively.  The  value  of  C  and Typescript is $406 million and $317 million, respectively, while Python has the lowest value of the top languages with around $55 million. JavaScript is not only the top language on GitHub since at least 2014 (GitHub, 2022) it is also the language with one of the highest values in our data. In contrast, Python became more popular over time moving up from the number four spot to the number two language being used in 2020 across all OSS packages on GitHub, while it is in the last spot of our top languages.\n\nPanel B shows the demand side value across the top programming languages. Based on usage generated value, Go is more than four times the value of the next language, JavaScript.\n\nTypescript (a language that extends JavaScript) has seen immense growth rising from the tenth spot of the top 10 languages in 2017 to the fourth spot in 2020 which is also reflected in our data with  Typescript  being  the  third  most  important  language  on  the  demand  side.  The  two  web languages are followed by C and far behind are Java, and Python.\n\nDocument 16: ## 5. Conclusion\n\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith. We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average value and distributed it across industries.\n\nIn this study we estimate the value of widely-used open source software globally with two unique datasets: the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data. We are able to estimate not only the supply side value of existing code (e.g., the cost it would take to rewrite each piece of widely-used OSS once) but also the demand side value for the private economy (e.g., the cost it would take for each company that uses a piece of OSS to rewrite it). While we do not focus on the long tail of OSS, we consider this an additional contribution of our study as focusing on OSS that is widely used allows us to more precisely understand the value created by OSS, rather than only measuring the  replacement  cost  for  all  OSS  (which  would  overestimate  the  true  value  since  many  OSS projects are not used in production code). However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n\nAdjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.  We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves.  Over  95%  percent  of  the  demand-side  value  is  generated  by  only  five  percent  of programmers, and those programmers contribute not only to a few widely used projects but to substantially more projects than the programmers that are engaged at the lower end of the value distribution.\n\nIn aggregate, our results show the substantial value that OSS contributes to the economy despite this value generally showing up as zero via direct measurement since prices equal zero and quantity is difficult to measure using public data alone. Our research lays the groundwork for future studies of not only OSS, but of all IT and its growing impact on the global economy.\n\nDocument 12: ## --- Table 1 about here ---\n\nTable  1  shows  descriptive  statistics  from  both  data  sets  separately.  The  inward-facing Census  (Panel  A)  contains  just  over  261.7  million  lines  of  code  with  72%  of  the  lines  being attributable to the top programming languages. The average package includes 142 thousand lines of code with a slightly lower average of 113 thousand lines of code for the subset of top languages. When considering the demand (usage) side, we observe that the Census packages were used over 2.7 million times while 92% of this usage is attributable to the top languages. The average package was used 1,472.4 times with a higher usage of around 1,497.5 for the top  languages.  For  the outward-facing  BuiltWith  data  we  find  similar  patterns,  but  at  different  levels.  The  packages included from BuiltWith include over 82 million lines of code, 71% of which are attributable to the  top  programming  languages.  The  average  package  within  the  BuiltWith  sample  has  111 thousand  lines  of  code  with  a  lower  average  of  around  80  thousand  lines  of  code  for  the  top languages. This is because our BuiltWith data primarily consists of JavaScript-based packages, which are often smaller than packages written in other languages. BuiltWith packages were used over 142 thousand times where 99.97% were attributable to the top languages. Next, we used these raw observations to calculate the value of all OSS through the labor market approach and estimated the value created from the supply and demand side.\n\n--- Table 2 about here ---\n\nTable 2 shows the estimates for the value of OSS based on the firm-relevant joint Census and BuiltWith sample. All estimates in Table 2 are based only on software languages classified in bucket  1  from  Table  A1,  which  are  the  most  likely  to  be  written  by  a  human  rather  than  a machine. 19 The first column contains estimates with wages from a low income country (India), the global  average  wage,  and  a  high  income  country  (United  States  of  America),  respectively  (as described above). To reproduce all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the idea of OSS still exists, but all current OSS is deleted and needs to be coded from scratch), using programmers at the average developer wage from India, it would require an investment of $1.22 billion. In contrast, if we use the average developer wage from the United States, then reproducing all widely-used OSS would require  an  investment  of  $6.22  billion.  Using  a  pool  of  programmers  from  across  the  world, weighed based on the existing geographic contributions to OSS as discussed above, would lead to an investment somewhere in between the low and high-income country, $4.15 billion. It is useful to compare these numbers to those from similar studies to understand differences in valuing all OSS (prior studies) versus that which is widely used (our study). Robbins et al. (2021) and Blind et al. (2021) use a method similar to ours and estimate that the value of OSS created in the US is $38 billion in 2019 and that created in the EU is €1 billion in 2018. Wachs et al. (2022) show that roughly 50% of OSS contributions come from the US and EU combined. In aggregate, that would lead these studies to give a global value of OSS of $78 billion. Thus, our middle estimate of a supply-side value of $4.15 billion for only firm-oriented and widely used OSS is a credible lowerbound and highlights the higher estimations of the total of supply-side value of OSS when not considering whether or not a given OSS package is widely used. This further indicates that the supply-side value of the most widely used OSS is roughly 5.5% of the supply-side value of all OSS.\n\nThe second column in Table 2 contains the demand side estimates based on the labor market approach. We find that if firms had to recreate all OSS packages they used (e.g., OSS itself no longer existed and every firm that used an OSS package had to recreate it), then the entire cost would amount to between $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion using labor from the low wage or high wage country only, respectively. A pool of programmers across the globe could recreate all of OSS that is being widely used for a cost of approximately $8.80 trillion. Interpreting this number is\n\n19 Tables in the appendix show the equivalent values from Table 2 when including software language buckets 1 and 2 (Table A3) and all three software language buckets (Table A4).\n\nslightly more complicated but still feasible. According to a Statista (2023) report, global software revenue in 2020 (the same year as our data) was $531.7 billion. However, this represents a flow, not a stock, of software. Relying on government estimates that software fully depreciates over three years, we can do a back of the envelope calculation and consider the purchase value of the full stock of prepackaged software used in 2020 as the aggregate of that sold from 2018 to 2020, which is $1.54 trillion. Further, this represents only the expenditure on prepackaged software and does  not  include  custom  purchased  or  in-house  developed  software.  Here,  the  best  obtainable estimates of private-sector investment in software overall come from the United States National Income and Product Accounts data (NIPA 2023). In 2020, the national account data shows that in the  US,  private  firms  spent  $479.2  billion  on  software,  of  which  45%  ($215.5  billion)  was prepackaged. If we assume this is a consistent ratio for the rest of the world, then the total amount firms spent on software being used in 2020 was $3.4 trillion (= $1.54 trillion\/0.45). Combining this rough estimate with the demand side estimate of the value of OSS based on an average global wage ($8.8 trillion), this indicates firms would spend $12.2 trillion (=$3.4 trillion + $8.8 trillion), or three and a half times what they currently spend if they needed to pay in-house developers to write the OSS that they currently use for free.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"simple","seed_document_id":14,"topic":"Others"}}

This approach calculates the labor replacement cost of each OSS package using COCOMO II at the individual package level and then sums across all package values to obtain a supply-side labor market replacement value. The supply-side value is then scaled by the number of times firms are using each package while removing multi-usage within each firm to obtain a demand-side value.","reference_context":"Document 11: ## 4. Results\n\nAfter applying the labor market approach using COCOMO II, we obtain global estimates for the value of OSS. To calculate the overall value, we first need the underlying number of lines of code (to calculate the supply-side value) and then the usage statistics (for the demand-side value). Since there may be substantial heterogeneity in value by programming languages, we also show the top programming languages during our investigation period in the year 2020, as discussed above.\n\nDocument 9: ## 3.1 Labor market approach\n\nFor the labor market approach, we estimate the value of OSS by calculating the replacement value of a package. We ask how much it would cost to reproduce the package by hiring a programmer and paying them a competitive market wage. To estimate this supply-side value ( 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; ) , we take the complete list of OSS packages discussed above, and then count the lines of code in each unique\n\n14 In an alternative version, we use a mixture of a labor and goods market approach that is more closely aligned with Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff, et al (2021). However, applying this method in our setting requires numerous additional assumptions due to data constraints. For simplicity we call it the goods market approach for which we provide the details and statistics, as well as the limitations in Appendix A.\n\npackage. 15 For each unique package,  , we calculate the value and then sum over all these values i to obtain the total value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nIn this calculation, we implicitly do not incorporate any production externalities since we assume that there is no spillover knowledge from one package to the next that would lower the cost of programming. 16 This methodology is similar to that used by other papers that estimate the supply-side costs of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021).\n\nWe then calculate the demand-side value of OSS by incorporating the usage information ( Q) for each package:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nHere, we do not incorporate consumption externalities, i.e., we do not allow a benefit to arise for the general public when a package has been created and we further make sure that each firm is only replacing a package they use once, since a replaced package can be used within a firm as a club good (e.g., see Cornes and Sandler, 1996). The value 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost to rewrite all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the concept of OSS still exists, but all of these packages needed to be rewritten from scratch), while the value 𝑉 + \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost for each firm that uses one of these OSS packages to pay a developer to rewrite those packages (e.g., OSS itself no longer exists).\n\nFor both the supply and demand models, we obtain the dollar-value for each package ( 𝑃 ( ) via the Constructive Cost Model II, also abbreviated as COCOMO II (Boehm 1984, Boehm et al. 2009). The model has previously been used by the United States Department of Defense to estimate software project costs as well as in prior research estimating the value of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021). It is a highly flexible model that allows us to create non-linear transformations of lines of code to dollar-values. It uses the following modelling equation:\n\n15 We use only the pure lines of code excluding documentation lines and empty lines. Hence, we underestimate the true value of recreating each package.\n\n16 Similar to a representative agent model (e.g. see Williamson 2006), one may think of each package being reproduced by separate programmers who are identical replicas of each other (and therefore have the same skill level, but do not become more efficient via learning).\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n( (\n\nwhere 𝐿 represents the lines of codes in thousands and E the effort in person-month units for each project  . Consistent with Blind et al. (2021), we use the default parameter values for i 𝛼 , 𝛽 and 𝜂. The parameters 𝛼 𝛽 , are non-linear adjustment factors set to 2.94, and 1.0997 respectively . The parameter 𝜂 is an effort-adjustment factor which can be modified to incorporate subjective assessments of product, hardware, personnel, and project attributes. Since we do not have a prior for each project, we set 𝜂 to the default value of one. To obtain the price ( 𝑃 ( ) of each OSS project, we  then  multiply  the  results  of  equation  (3)  by  the  weighted  global  wage  that  an  average programmer would obtain on the open market. To calculate a global wage, we include the base monthly salaries of software developers from Salary Expert for the top 30 countries in terms of their GitHub developer counts in 2021 (Wachs et al., 2022). 17 The weight of each country is its share of active GitHub contributors over the total contributors in the top 30 countries. We further create bounds by using a low-wage (India) and high-wage (USA) labor market for the wage to better understand how the value would vary by the pool of programmers used to recreate all of OSS. 18\n\nDocument 8: ## 3. Methodology\n\nWe first measure the value of OSS by considering the supply and the demand side of OSS using a labor market approach. 14 The thought experiment is that we live in a world where OSS does not exist and has to be recreated at each firm that uses a given piece of OSS. Using the labor market approach, we calculate the labor replacement cost of each OSS package. To estimate the value for each package, we use COCOMO II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) at the individual package level and then sum across all package values to obtain a supply-side labor market replacement value. Then, we scale the supply-side value by the number of times firms are using each package while removing multi-usage within each firm to obtain a demand-side value.\n\nSecond, we move beyond the aggregate and inspect inequality in the value creation process. In OSS, as with many creative endeavors, it is common that a small handful of individuals provide the bulk of the contributions, while many others make small contributions (sometimes referred to as the 80\/20 rule, implying 80% of the work is done by 20% of the people). Research has shown these frequent contributors often attain positions of influence in OSS communities as a result of their efforts (Hanisch, et al, 2018). Therefore, to better understand the dispersion of value creation across developers, we first use the GHTorrent data and identify individual developer contributions in two ways: a) through their OSS value contributions directly and b) through the total number of repositories they contributed to. We then test how concentrated these two contribution measures are to better understand whether many or few developers contribute to the total value we measure. We explain the exact details for the labor market approach and the inequality of valuations below.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"simple","seed_document_id":11,"topic":"Others"}}

Panel A shows the supply side value with the labor value being displayed on the vertical axis. We find that OSS packages created in Go have the highest value with $803 million in value that would have to be created from scratch if the OSS packages did not exist. Go is closely followed by JavaScript  and  Java  with  $758  million  and  $658  million,  respectively.  The  value  of  C  and Typescript is $406 million and $317 million, respectively, while Python has the lowest value of the top languages with around $55 million. JavaScript is not only the top language on GitHub since at least 2014 (GitHub, 2022) it is also the language with one of the highest values in our data. In contrast, Python became more popular over time moving up from the number four spot to the number two language being used in 2020 across all OSS packages on GitHub, while it is in the last spot of our top languages.\n\nPanel B shows the demand side value across the top programming languages. Based on usage generated value, Go is more than four times the value of the next language, JavaScript.\n\nTypescript (a language that extends JavaScript) has seen immense growth rising from the tenth spot of the top 10 languages in 2017 to the fourth spot in 2020 which is also reflected in our data with  Typescript  being  the  third  most  important  language  on  the  demand  side.  The  two  web languages are followed by C and far behind are Java, and Python.\n\nDocument 14: ## --- Figure 2 about here ---\n\nFigure 2 splits the OSS value estimates for each language by our inward facing (Census) and outward facing (BuiltWith) data sources. Panel A and Panel B focus on the supply and demand side estimation for the Census. We obtain a similar pattern that has been established already in the aggregate when pooling both data sources (Figure 1) albeit the impact of JavaScript is substantially lower.  On  the  supply  side  of  the  Census  in  Panel  A,  Java  has  the  second-highest  value  while JavaScript  code  from  the  Census  contributes  to  a  substantially  lower  value  to  the  aggregate. Similarly, the supply side values of C, Python, and Typescript are mainly driven by the Census. From the demand side Panel B we find that Go is the most popular language for inward facing code while all other languages appear to be negligible in relative terms.\n\nFigure 2, Panel C and Panel D show the supply and demand side values for the BuiltWith dataset. The supply side value in Panel C clearly indicates that the value from the BuiltWith sample is driven by JavaScript code, which is a good sanity check since we focused on JavaScript packages to proxy for OSS in the BuiltWith sample, as discussed above. The second highest value is created by TypeScript which is reassuring since it is a superset of JavaScript. Panel D shows a similar pattern  on  the  usage  side  where  most  of  the  value  arises  from  JavaScript  while  TypeScript  is trailing at the second spot as well. The other languages contribute only marginal amounts to the supply and demand side values. Overall, these findings are broadly consistent with the main use cases of the various languages (web programming vs. application programming) and an idea that languages through which value are generated are not necessarily identical to languages that are used by the general public.\n\n--- Figure 3 about here ---\n\nFigure 3 shows the demand-side value of OSS across industries by NAICS 2-digit codes using the BuiltWith online data. 20 This can be interpreted as the value each of these industries receive because OSS exists. The industry with the highest usage value of around $43 billion is 'Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.' 'Retail Trade' as well as 'Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services' make up another large part of the demand-side externally facing value of OSS with $36 billion and $35 billion, respectively. In contrast, industries that constitute just a small portion of the value are 'Mining, Quarrying, and Oil  and  Gas  Extraction',  'Utilities',  'Agriculture,  Forestry,  Fishing,  and  Hunting.'  The  latter industries are classical non-service sector industries and as such software is expected to play less of a role there.\n\nDocument 12: ## --- Table 1 about here ---\n\nTable  1  shows  descriptive  statistics  from  both  data  sets  separately.  The  inward-facing Census  (Panel  A)  contains  just  over  261.7  million  lines  of  code  with  72%  of  the  lines  being attributable to the top programming languages. The average package includes 142 thousand lines of code with a slightly lower average of 113 thousand lines of code for the subset of top languages. When considering the demand (usage) side, we observe that the Census packages were used over 2.7 million times while 92% of this usage is attributable to the top languages. The average package was used 1,472.4 times with a higher usage of around 1,497.5 for the top  languages.  For  the outward-facing  BuiltWith  data  we  find  similar  patterns,  but  at  different  levels.  The  packages included from BuiltWith include over 82 million lines of code, 71% of which are attributable to the  top  programming  languages.  The  average  package  within  the  BuiltWith  sample  has  111 thousand  lines  of  code  with  a  lower  average  of  around  80  thousand  lines  of  code  for  the  top languages. This is because our BuiltWith data primarily consists of JavaScript-based packages, which are often smaller than packages written in other languages. BuiltWith packages were used over 142 thousand times where 99.97% were attributable to the top languages. Next, we used these raw observations to calculate the value of all OSS through the labor market approach and estimated the value created from the supply and demand side.\n\n--- Table 2 about here ---\n\nTable 2 shows the estimates for the value of OSS based on the firm-relevant joint Census and BuiltWith sample. All estimates in Table 2 are based only on software languages classified in bucket  1  from  Table  A1,  which  are  the  most  likely  to  be  written  by  a  human  rather  than  a machine. 19 The first column contains estimates with wages from a low income country (India), the global  average  wage,  and  a  high  income  country  (United  States  of  America),  respectively  (as described above). To reproduce all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the idea of OSS still exists, but all current OSS is deleted and needs to be coded from scratch), using programmers at the average developer wage from India, it would require an investment of $1.22 billion. In contrast, if we use the average developer wage from the United States, then reproducing all widely-used OSS would require  an  investment  of  $6.22  billion.  Using  a  pool  of  programmers  from  across  the  world, weighed based on the existing geographic contributions to OSS as discussed above, would lead to an investment somewhere in between the low and high-income country, $4.15 billion. It is useful to compare these numbers to those from similar studies to understand differences in valuing all OSS (prior studies) versus that which is widely used (our study). Robbins et al. (2021) and Blind et al. (2021) use a method similar to ours and estimate that the value of OSS created in the US is $38 billion in 2019 and that created in the EU is €1 billion in 2018. Wachs et al. (2022) show that roughly 50% of OSS contributions come from the US and EU combined. In aggregate, that would lead these studies to give a global value of OSS of $78 billion. Thus, our middle estimate of a supply-side value of $4.15 billion for only firm-oriented and widely used OSS is a credible lowerbound and highlights the higher estimations of the total of supply-side value of OSS when not considering whether or not a given OSS package is widely used. This further indicates that the supply-side value of the most widely used OSS is roughly 5.5% of the supply-side value of all OSS.\n\nThe second column in Table 2 contains the demand side estimates based on the labor market approach. We find that if firms had to recreate all OSS packages they used (e.g., OSS itself no longer existed and every firm that used an OSS package had to recreate it), then the entire cost would amount to between $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion using labor from the low wage or high wage country only, respectively. A pool of programmers across the globe could recreate all of OSS that is being widely used for a cost of approximately $8.80 trillion. Interpreting this number is\n\n19 Tables in the appendix show the equivalent values from Table 2 when including software language buckets 1 and 2 (Table A3) and all three software language buckets (Table A4).\n\nslightly more complicated but still feasible. According to a Statista (2023) report, global software revenue in 2020 (the same year as our data) was $531.7 billion. However, this represents a flow, not a stock, of software. Relying on government estimates that software fully depreciates over three years, we can do a back of the envelope calculation and consider the purchase value of the full stock of prepackaged software used in 2020 as the aggregate of that sold from 2018 to 2020, which is $1.54 trillion. Further, this represents only the expenditure on prepackaged software and does  not  include  custom  purchased  or  in-house  developed  software.  Here,  the  best  obtainable estimates of private-sector investment in software overall come from the United States National Income and Product Accounts data (NIPA 2023). In 2020, the national account data shows that in the  US,  private  firms  spent  $479.2  billion  on  software,  of  which  45%  ($215.5  billion)  was prepackaged. If we assume this is a consistent ratio for the rest of the world, then the total amount firms spent on software being used in 2020 was $3.4 trillion (= $1.54 trillion\/0.45). Combining this rough estimate with the demand side estimate of the value of OSS based on an average global wage ($8.8 trillion), this indicates firms would spend $12.2 trillion (=$3.4 trillion + $8.8 trillion), or three and a half times what they currently spend if they needed to pay in-house developers to write the OSS that they currently use for free.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"simple","seed_document_id":13,"topic":"Others"}}

Introduction\n\nIn 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that 'software is eating the world' (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that 'open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,' (Jacks, 2022). Other recent studies have come to similar conclusions showing that open source software  (OSS)  -  software  whose  source  code  is  publicly  available  for  inspection,  use,  and modification and is often created in a decentralized manner and distributed for free - appears in 96% of codebases (Synopsys 2023), and that some commercial software consists of up to 99.9% freely available OSS (Musseau et al., 2022). Although in its early days OSS frequently copied features from existing proprietary software, OSS today includes cutting edge technology in various fields including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, big data, and analytics.  However, despite the increasing importance of OSS to all software (and therefore to the entire economy), measuring its impact has been elusive. Traditionally, to measure the value created by a good or service,  economists  multiply  the  price  ( p )  times  the  quantity  sold  ( q ).  However,  in  OSS, p is generally zero since the source code is publicly available, and q is  unknown due to the limited number of restrictions around how the code may be copied and reused. For example, if a company downloads  a  piece  of  OSS  from  a  public  code  repository,  it  may  copy  it  thousands  of  times internally (legally) and then share it with suppliers or customers (also legally), so public download data is insufficient. Although some recent studies have sought to estimate the value of p (discussed below), data for estimating q has been unavailable or intractable for anything more than just a handful of OSS packages. Using newly collected data from multiple sources, the goal of this paper is to provide estimates for both p and q and to use those to shine light on the question: What is the value of open source software?\n\nUnderstanding the value of OSS is of critical importance not only due to the role it plays in the economy, but also due to it being one of the most successful and impactful modern examples of the centuries old economic concept of 'the commons' which run the risk of meeting the fate known as 'the tragedy of the commons.' This concept can trace its roots as far back as the 4 th -century BC philosopher Aristotle who wrote 'That which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care. Men pay most attention to what is their own and care less for what is common.'  (Aristotle,  1981).  William  Forster  Lloyd  (1833)  resurfaced  the  idea  in  modern economic thought by highlighting the example of shared tracts of land used for cattle grazing by\n\nmultiple cattle herders who each had an incentive to overuse the shared resource. Garrett Hardin (1968)  brought  the  concept  into  the  broader  zeitgeist  when  he  wrote  an  article  discussing  the problem entitled 'The Tragedy of the Commons.' Building on this work, Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for her research highlighting paths to avoiding the tragedy of the commons through community coordination efforts that did not necessitate government enforced laws to manage and guard the commons (Ostrom 1990). The parallels between shared grazing lands and shared digital infrastructure are palpable - the availability of communal grass to feed cattle, and in turn feed people, was critical to the agrarian economy, and the ability to not have to recreate code that someone else has already written is critical to the modern economy. Further, in both contexts, despite knowing grass and code are critical inputs to the economy, measuring their actual value is difficult. And, as the renowned mathematician and physicist Lord Kelvin is believed to have said, 'If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.' And if you cannot improve and maintain it, such common goods may crumble under the weight of their own success as they are overused, but underinvested in (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021). Therefore, measuring the value OSS creates is crucial to the future health of the digital economy, and the rest of the economy that is built on top of it.\n\nImportantly, recent studies have attempted to address these measurement issues but fall short of capturing both the breadth and depth of OSS usage - a gap we seek to fill with this paper. For example, researchers have attempted to gain breadth by using novel methodologies to estimate the labor replacement value of the current corpus of OSS created in the United States at $38 billion in 2019 (Robbins et al., 2021) and that created in the European Union at €1 billion (Blind et al., 2021) by imputing the labor costs that it would have taken to rewrite existing OSS. Such efforts do a very good job at estimating what it would cost to replace all existing OSS if it disappeared tomorrow. However, the resultant estimates rely on two important assumptions. First, that all OSS is equally valuable from a usage standpoint, and second that the concept of OSS would still exist, and society would just need to rewrite the code once, thus addressing the aforementioned problem of a missing value for p , but not addressing the missing value of q . In a world where OSS did not exist at all, then each piece of OSS software would not need to be rewritten just once, but instead would need to be rewritten by every firm that used the software (assuming the firm could freely share the software within its boundaries). Other research (Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; MurcianoGoroff, Zhuo, and Greenstein, 2021) has gone deeper into this hypothetical, albeit in a narrow\n\nmanner, by only focusing on web servers (which are public facing on the Internet and can therefore be readily measured). Using different methods, both studies measure q for this one type of software and impute p by using a goods replacement value approach based on the prices for closed-source alternatives offered by firms. With data from the United States the resulting estimates show a value of  $2  billion  for  the  OSS  Apache  Web  Server  in  2012  (Greenstein  and  Nagle,  2014)  and  a combined value of $4.5 billion for Apache and the increasingly popular OSS web server nginx in 2018 (Murciano-Goroff, et al., 2021). However, although web servers are an important part of the OSS  ecosystem,  they  constitute  a  small  portion  of  it.  We  seek  to  build  upon  the  important contributions this existing research has made in an attempt to go both broad and deep to create a more complete measure of the value of OSS.\n\nTo consider the value of OSS in both a broad and deep manner, we use data from two primary sources that allow us to gain insights into the OSS used at tens of thousands of firms across the world. The first is the 'Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries' (Nagle et al., 2022). The Census II project utilized partnerships with multiple software composition analysis (SCA) firms to create various lists of the most widely used OSS. SCAs are hired to scan the codebases of a company to ensure they are not violating any OSS licenses and, as a byproduct, track all the OSS code used by their customers and the products they build. The Census II project aggregated data from multiple SCAs to build a dataset of OSS usage at tens of thousands of firms based  on  millions  of  data  points  (observations  of  OSS  usage).  The  second  data  source  is  the BuiltWith dataset, from which we leverage scans of nearly nine million websites to identify the underlying technology deployed by these websites, including OSS libraries. The BuiltWith data has been used in multiple academic studies (DeStefano &amp; Timmis 2023, Dushnitsky &amp; Stroube 2021, Koning et al.. 2022), but to our knowledge this is the first one to focus on OSS usage. The Census II data and the BuiltWith data are complementary as the former focuses on OSS that is built  into  the  software  a  company  sells,  while  the  latter  focuses  on  OSS  that  is  built  into  a company's website, thus reducing the chances of double-counting observations across the datasets. In aggregate, these two datasets combined create the most complete measurement of OSS usage ( q ) to date. Further, by focusing on OSS that is widely deployed and used by firms, rather than considering all the projects that exist in an OSS repository, we enhance the methodologies of prior studies by reducing the likelihood of measurement error stemming from projects that are posted as publicly available OSS but are not actually used in any practical manner. Not accounting for this\n\nmeasurement error would lead to overestimation of the actual value of OSS as projects that are widely used would be valued in the same way as projects that are not used at all.\n\nTo estimate p ,  we  follow  the  literature  discussed  above  and  use  the  labor  replacement value. First, we calculate the labor cost it would take an individual firm to recreate a given OSS package by measuring the number of lines of code within the package and then applying the Constructive Cost Model II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) - also known as COCOMO II to estimate the number of person-hours it would take to write the code from scratch. We then utilize global wage data from Salary Expert to get an accurate estimate of the labor costs a firm would incur if this piece of OSS did not exist. These costs can be combined with the q values from above at the OSS package level to estimate the combined value of all OSS from both the supply and demand sides.\n\nWe find a value ranging from $1.22 billion to $6.22 billion if we were to decide as a society to recreate all widely used OSS on the supply side. However, considering the actual usage of OSS leads to a demand-side value that is orders of magnitude larger and ranges from $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion, if each firm who used an OSS package had to recreate it from scratch (e.g., the concept of OSS did not exist). We document substantial heterogeneity of the value of OSS by programming  language  and  internal  vs  outward-facing  programming  efforts.  Further,  we  find considerable  heterogeneity  in  value  contributions  by  programmers  as  5%  of  programmers  are responsible for more than 90% of the value created on the supply- and demand- side. The data we use is arguably the most comprehensive source of data to measure the value created by firm usage of OSS at this time. However, as for any project, the evidence is not complete and we argue that we underestimate the value since our data, e.g., does not include operating systems, which are a substantial omitted category of OSS.\n\nThis study makes four important contributions to the academic literature, practitioners, and policy makers. First, it provides the most complete estimate of the value of widely used OSS to date  by  accounting  for  not  only  the  supply-side  of  OSS  (price  to  create  it),  but  also  for  the usage\/demand-side at a scale that has not been done before. While prior estimates of the value of OSS only went either broad (estimating the supply-side costs of a large swath of OSS) or deep (estimating the value created by one particular type of OSS), this study does both by using unique datasets that allow for a better understanding of the breadth and depth of OSS usage. Further, rather than measuring the value of all OSS, this study focuses on the value of OSS that is used by firms\n\nto create its products and websites, limiting the measurement error occurring in studies that are unable to account for which OSS is actually used in production. This contribution builds upon, and extends, important research (e.g., Blind et al., 2021; Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021; Robbins et al., 2021) that has sought to identify the value of this vital resource that contributes a great deal to the modern economy despite the difficulties measuring this contribution. In  doing  so,  it  adds  insights  to  a  long-running  discussion  related  to  the  impact  of  information technology (IT) on productivity (Brynjolfsson, 1993; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 1996; Nagle, 2019a; Solow, 1987) known as the 'productivity paradox' where IT investments can have limited impact on productivity statistics. This debate has continued into the emerging context of AI (Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson, 2018). Our work contributes to this conversation by highlighting a massive societal level cost-savings (and hence productivity enhancement) that is created by the existence of OSS.\n\nSecond, our research contributes methodological advances to the study of intangible capital by highlighting novel sources of data related to investments in OSS. Prior research has shown that intangible capital plays an increasingly important role in economic growth (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel,  2009)  and  firm  value  (Peters  and  Taylor,  2017),  but  it  often  goes  unmeasured  or misattributed (Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou, 2014). Further, we demonstrate how these data sources can be used to understand the true investments in software that a firm makes, and that which they would have to make if OSS did not exist.  This  is  valuable  as  investments  in  software  are  an increasingly important type of intangible capital that is driving innovation (Branstetter, Drev, and Kwon, 2019) and performance (Krishnan et al., 2000).\n\nThird, our results help highlight for firms and managers the importance of OSS to their production, and ideally add weight to arguments that users of OSS should not just free ride but also contribute to the creation and maintenance of OSS (e.g., Henkel, 2008; Nagle, 2018). Such contributions are a fraction of the costs that firms would incur if OSS did not exist and the active participation of OSS users in helping maintain the OSS they use is critical to the health and future well-being of the OSS ecosystem (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021; Zhang et al., 2019).\n\nFourth,  and  finally,  our  study  helps  inform  policymakers  who  have  recently  started  to understand  the  growing  importance  of  OSS  to  the  economy  and  taken  actions  to  support  the ecosystem (European Commission, 2020; Executive Order No. 14028, 2021). However, most of these efforts are related to securing the existing OSS ecosystem, which is quite important, but do\n\nnot go as far as supporting the creation of new OSS. Our results help shine light on the importance of OSS to the overall economy and add weight to calls for more societal support of this critical resource. Our results further show that the majority of the value created by OSS is created by a small  number  of  contributors.  Although  it  has  long  been  known  that  a  small  number  of  OSS contributors do most of the work, we add new insights that show this is even more true for the value creation of widely-used OSS projects and that societal support for these individuals is critical to the future success of OSS, and in turn, the economy.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the empirical setting and data. Section 3 discusses the methods including measurement challenges. In section 4, we estimate the value of open source software. Section 5 concludes.\n\nDocument 16: ## 5. Conclusion\n\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith. We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average value and distributed it across industries.\n\nIn this study we estimate the value of widely-used open source software globally with two unique datasets: the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data. We are able to estimate not only the supply side value of existing code (e.g., the cost it would take to rewrite each piece of widely-used OSS once) but also the demand side value for the private economy (e.g., the cost it would take for each company that uses a piece of OSS to rewrite it). While we do not focus on the long tail of OSS, we consider this an additional contribution of our study as focusing on OSS that is widely used allows us to more precisely understand the value created by OSS, rather than only measuring the  replacement  cost  for  all  OSS  (which  would  overestimate  the  true  value  since  many  OSS projects are not used in production code). However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n\nAdjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.  We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves.  Over  95%  percent  of  the  demand-side  value  is  generated  by  only  five  percent  of programmers, and those programmers contribute not only to a few widely used projects but to substantially more projects than the programmers that are engaged at the lower end of the value distribution.\n\nIn aggregate, our results show the substantial value that OSS contributes to the economy despite this value generally showing up as zero via direct measurement since prices equal zero and quantity is difficult to measure using public data alone. Our research lays the groundwork for future studies of not only OSS, but of all IT and its growing impact on the global economy.\n\nDocument 5: ## Abstract\n\nThe  value  of  a  non-pecuniary  (free)  product  is  inherently  difficult  to  assess.  A  pervasive example is open source software (OSS), a global public good that plays a vital role in the economy and is foundational for most technology we use today. However, it is difficult to measure the value of OSS due to its non-pecuniary nature and lack of centralized usage tracking. Therefore, OSS remains largely unaccounted for in economic measures. Although prior studies have estimated the supply-side costs to recreate this software, a lack of data has hampered estimating the much larger demand-side (usage) value created by OSS. Therefore, to understand the complete economic and social value of widely-used OSS, we leverage unique global data from two complementary sources capturing  OSS  usage  by  millions  of  global  firms.  We  first  estimate  the  supply-side  value  by calculating the cost to recreate the most widely used OSS once. We then calculate the demandside value based on a replacement value for each firm that uses the software and would need to build it internally if OSS did not exist. We estimate the supply-side value of widely-used OSS is $4.15 billion, but that the demand-side value is much larger at $8.8 trillion. We find that firms would need to spend 3.5 times more on software than they currently do if OSS did not exist. The top six programming languages in our sample comprise 84% of the demand-side value of OSS. Further, 96% of the demand-side value is created by only 5% of OSS developers.\n\nJEL Classification:\n\nH4; O3; J0\n\nKeywords: Open-source software, global public good\n\nAcknowledgement: The authors are grateful for  financial  and  administrative  support  from  the Linux  Foundation  without  which  the  data  from  the  Census  would  not  have  otherwise  been available.

Empirical Setting and Data\n\nAlthough the concept of free and open software has existed since the 1950's, it became more popular in the 1980's due to the efforts of Richard Stallman and his launch of the GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation (Maracke, 2019). However, it was in the 1990's that OSS took off after Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel, a now widely adopted OSS operating system (Tozzi, 2016). Today, OSS is considered a key building block of the digital economy and is widely used by software developers in everything from phones to cars to refrigerators to cutting-edge AI (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021).\n\nWe use two complementary main data sources to estimate the value of OSS. The first is the Census and is inward facing. It allows us to identify OSS code that goes into products that firms create. The second dataset is BuiltWith and is outward facing, allowing us to identify OSS code  that  consumers  directly  interact  with  through  firm  websites.  Since  the  raw  data  in  both datasets only contains package names, version numbers, and package manager names, and does not  contain  any  source  code  related  information,  we  first  obtain  the  publicly  accessible  code repository for each package which includes package-level information including the lines of code and  the  programming  languages  used.  One  may  worry  about  double-counting  for  the  value calculations as a result of using two separate datasets. However, the overlap of both the Census and  the  BuiltWith  sample  is  very  small:  there  are  only  18  packages  found  in  both  datasets. Moreover, it is unlikely that double counting is a concern as the two datasets capture different dimensions of OSS usage: the Census captures packaged software whose usage is inward-facing while BuiltWith captures usage in websites that are outward-facing. Finally, as a supplementary\n\ndataset, we use GHTorrent, a detailed history of OSS-related activity on GitHub, the most popular OSS hosting platform and a commonly used data source for studies of OSS (e.g., Burton et al, 2017; Conti, Peukert, and Roche, 2023; Fackler, Hofmann, and Laurentsyeva, 2023; Kim, 2020; Tang, Wang, &amp; Tong, 2023). This detailed historical data allows us to go deeper into how the value  of  OSS  is  created  by  better  understanding  the  dispersion  of  the  contributions  across individual OSS developers. We describe the details of all three data sources and their preparation for estimation below.\n\nCensus. The  Census  II  of  Free  and  Open  Source  Software  (here:  Census)  was  jointly undertaken by the Linux Foundation and the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (Nagle et  al.,  2022). 1 The  Census  was  created  via  the  aggregation  of  data  from  three  major  software composition analysis (SCA) firms with thousands of clients across the globe. SCAs are hired to scan the codebase of a client and gather the OSS usage embedded in their proprietary software to ensure they are not violating any OSS license agreements.  Frequently this takes place as part of 2 the due diligence process related to mergers and acquisitions. Unlike other OSS demand measures available from public sources such as package download counts and code changes, the way this data was collected ensures that we observe the precise amount and type of internal OSS usage of the firms. In addition, it allows us to trace the dependencies each package relies on, so that we can observe the indirect OSS usage that is commonly hidden and difficult to obtain.  The result is over 3 2.7 million observations of OSS packages being used within products created by the SCA client firms for the calendar year 2020 (January 1 to December 31, 2020). 4\n\nThe Census project standardized package names based on the naming system of libraries.io -  a  widely  used  site  maintained  by  Tidelift  that  organizes  information  about  more  than  eight million open source packages. The Census focused on the top 2,000 packages based on usage\n\n1 The precise methodologies for the data collection and aggregation are detailed in the Census report by Nagle et al (2022).\n\n2 OSS usage licenses vary a great deal and while some licenses are very open and allow the code to be reused in any manner, including within proprietary code that will be made available for sale at a non-zero price, other licenses restrict reuse to only be allowed if the resultant code is released under the same OSS license (known as copyleft). A detailed discussion of OSS licenses can be found in Lerner and Tirole (2005) and Almeida et al (2017).\n\n3 Indirect OSS usage is captured by dependency analysis and is necessary to accurately measure the full breadth of the OSS a firm relies on. For example, if a firm's proprietary code calls OSS package A, but package A, in turn, calls package B, then only looking at the direct calls would miss that package B was a required building block for the firm's proprietary code.\n\n4 The Census defines an OSS package as 'a unit of software that can be installed and managed by a package manager,' and  defines  a  package  manager  as  'software  that  automates  the  process  of  installing  and  otherwise  managing packages' (Nagle et al, 2022).\n\nreported from the three of the most prominent SCA vendors to identify the most widely used OSS rather  than  the  long-tail  of  the  usage  distribution.  This  led  to  packages  with  less  than  five observations  of  usage  being  dropped.  Since  packages  written  in  the  JavaScript  programming language, and usually hosted on the Node Package Manager (NPM), are generally smaller (fewer lines  of  code)  than  packages  in  other  languages  and  therefore  frequently  have  higher  usage numbers (since developers must include many small packages instead of a few large packages), the Census separately selected the top 1,000 NPM packages and the top 1,000 non-NPM hosted packages.\n\nThis final dataset covers 70% of the total usage of OSS observed in the raw data of the census.   For  each  of  these  2,000  OSS  packages  in  the  Census,  we  identified  the  raw  code 5 maintained on GitHub, the most widely used platform for hosting OSS.  We first attempted to 6 obtain the GitHub repository uniform resource locator (URL) for each package from libraries.io. We were able to match 1,657 packages to repositories via this initial method.  For URLs without 7 a  matching  repository,  we  performed  Google  searches  loosely  following  the  method  in  Singh (2020). More specifically, for each unmatched package, we used the Google API to search for the package name and 'GitHub Repository' and treated the first GitHub repository URL in the results as  its  best  matched  GitHub  URL.   This  resulted  in  an  additional  174  packages  matched  to  a 8 repository. Finally, we manually searched for URLs for the remaining 169 packages to identify the relevant repository. This entire process resulted in matching 1,840 out of the 2,000 Census packages to a code repository with the raw source code for the package. The unmatched packages were determined to have been either removed from GitHub or became proprietary (and thus the original source code was no longer available) and hence, the manual search allowed us to drop\n\n5 The packages that made up the remaining 30% of the full Census data in the long-tail usage distribution were not shared in the final report and therefore cannot be included in our analysis.\n\n6 GitHub  is  a  hosting  and  collaboration  platform  that  contributors  can  use  to  coordinate  the  development  and distribution of OSS projects. Founded in 2008, GitHub has become the largest hub for OSS development in the world. In January 2023, GitHub had more than 370 million repositories and over 100 million developers. In addition to personal users, a wide range of private firms actively use the GitHub platform, including Microsoft (which bought GitHub in 2018), Facebook, Google, and numerous other small and large firms.\n\n7 We attempted to access all repository URLs obtained as a sanity check to ensure they are in working condition. For those we could not access on GitHub, we manually found the correct URLs.\n\n8 As a robustness check, we randomly selected 50 package-repository matches derived from the Google Search method and we checked them by hand. All matches were manually confirmed to be correct providing additional support for the automated matching method.\n\nthese 160 unmatched packages (less than 8% of the Census sample of 2,000) with high confidence from our analysis.\n\nBuiltWith. The BuiltWith data contains scans of all public websites across the globe and identifies the technologies they use. Unlike the inward facing Census data which focus on the usage of OSS, the BuiltWith data scan for the use of both proprietary and OSS in firm websites without explicit differentiation. To separate OSS from proprietary software in BuiltWith, we turn to the subset of all open source web development software in the technology category that includes \"JavaScript and its libraries,\" which generates 778 observations corresponding to the NPM OSS category  in  the  Census  data.  There  are  two  reasons  for  this  sampling  choice.  First,  this  given category is constructed by BuiltWith and we use it as a proxy for OSS to separate it from pecuniary software.  Second,  JavaScript,  one  of  the  core  technologies  for  building  websites,  is  the  most popular programming language by usage on GitHub (GitHub, 2022) and thus enables us to capture the most important OSS from the demand side perspective. The scans include 8.8 million unique websites and 72.8 million corresponding observations of OSS usage from January 1 to November 16, 2020. Further, to ensure that we measure the value of OSS usage generated by the private sector,  we  match  the  adopting  domains  of  the  JavaScript-related  OSS  from  BuiltWith  with company websites recorded in Orbis, Compustat, and PitchBook, three commonly used databases of corporate activity that capture registered businesses across the world. Performing this match ensures that OSS used by non-commercial websites (e.g., an individual person's personal website) is excluded in our analysis. This results in a match-rate of 38.6%, which corresponds to around 3.4 million websites of distinct firms.\n\nFor the BuiltWith data, we cannot employ the first method we use for the Census (using libraries.io to help identify the repository URL) since only the technology names associated with the  packages  were  provided  by  BuiltWith,  and  other  information  (e.g.,  package  and  package manager  names)  is  not  included. 9 Hence,  we  start  by  performing  the  Google  Search  method mentioned above which results in a match of 695 packages to repositories. We then manually searched the Github URLs for 83 of the remaining unmatched packages, resulting in an addition of 46 packages. In total, for the BuiltWith data we were able to identify 741 out of 778 package-\n\n9 Since the package and package manager names are missing, a precise match using libraries.io was not feasible. Technology names are product names intended for customers and can be less technical and precise than the package names for internal development purposes. Thus, using technology names in a libraries.io search could cause significant ambiguity.\n\nrepository matches. As with the Census data, the remaining 37 unmatched packages (less than 5%) are dropped from our analysis because they had been deleted from GitHub.\n\nGHTorrent database. To obtain measures of the dispersion of the OSS value creation, we utilize  the  GHTorrent  database,  which  contains  the  entire  activity  history  on  GitHub  using GitHub's Representational State Transfer (REST) application programming interface (API). We leveraged  its  records  of  GitHub  repositories,  developer-level  commits,  and  developer  public profile information to estimate the contribution of each developer. We narrowed the sample for our developer contribution analysis in two steps. First, we winnowed the GitHub repositories and their  commits  from  GHTorrent  based  on  the  repository  URLs  of  our  joint  Census-BuiltWith sample. 10 Second, we focus on human contributions to OSS by removing approximately eight thousand (12%) GitHub contributors that we considered to be robots. 11 The final sample contains around sixty thousand developers and 2.3 million commits.\n\nTo prepare these three datasets for estimation, we first identified the number of lines of code and the programming languages used for each package using the OSS packages pygount (to count  the  number  of  lines  of  code)  and  linguist  (to  identify  programming  languages). 12 We categorize each distinct language into one of three different buckets moving from more likely human-written to more likely machine-written (see Table A1). Bucket 1 contains programming and markup languages (which are most likely to be human-written), bucket 3 contains data (most likely to be machine-written), and bucket 2 contains anything in between, such as config files and batch processing (which are sometimes human-written and sometimes machine-written, but it is difficult to tell based purely on looking at the code). 13 For our primary estimation we only use bucket 1 while providing robustness checks for buckets 2 and 3 in the Appendix, and thus our results represent a lower bound. Finally, for some analyses we dig deeper and show the top 5 programming languages (as classified by GitHub, 2022 for the year 2020; the year our data is from). The top 5 programming languages contain C (including C# and C++), Java, JavaScript,\n\n10 The match rate is over 96%, with the unmatched repositories accounting for only 0.15% of our calculated OSS demand value discussed below.\n\n11 The filtering is based on the 'fake user' classification by GHTorrent, as well as any usernames containing words 'bot' or 'robot', surrounded by special characters. This method is more conservative than other methods of bot detection  like  that  used  in  the  GitHub  Innovation  Graph  (https:\/\/innovationgraph.github.com\/),  which  rely  on  a monthly commit frequency threshold.\n\n12 https:\/\/pypi.org\/project\/pygount\/ and https:\/\/github.com\/github-linguist\/linguist\n\n13 Note that our focus is the cost to recreate OSS code written by humans, not robots. However, directly removing all OSS contributions from robot accounts is infeasible here, because we cannot observe the exact lines of code written by the robot accounts on GitHub.\n\nPython, and Typescript.

It also considers a goods market approach as an alternative method, although it places stronger emphasis on the labor cost approach.","reference_context":"Document 8: ## 3. Methodology\n\nWe first measure the value of OSS by considering the supply and the demand side of OSS using a labor market approach. 14 The thought experiment is that we live in a world where OSS does not exist and has to be recreated at each firm that uses a given piece of OSS. Using the labor market approach, we calculate the labor replacement cost of each OSS package. To estimate the value for each package, we use COCOMO II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) at the individual package level and then sum across all package values to obtain a supply-side labor market replacement value. Then, we scale the supply-side value by the number of times firms are using each package while removing multi-usage within each firm to obtain a demand-side value.\n\nSecond, we move beyond the aggregate and inspect inequality in the value creation process. In OSS, as with many creative endeavors, it is common that a small handful of individuals provide the bulk of the contributions, while many others make small contributions (sometimes referred to as the 80\/20 rule, implying 80% of the work is done by 20% of the people). Research has shown these frequent contributors often attain positions of influence in OSS communities as a result of their efforts (Hanisch, et al, 2018). Therefore, to better understand the dispersion of value creation across developers, we first use the GHTorrent data and identify individual developer contributions in two ways: a) through their OSS value contributions directly and b) through the total number of repositories they contributed to. We then test how concentrated these two contribution measures are to better understand whether many or few developers contribute to the total value we measure. We explain the exact details for the labor market approach and the inequality of valuations below.\n\nDocument 9: ## 3.1 Labor market approach\n\nFor the labor market approach, we estimate the value of OSS by calculating the replacement value of a package. We ask how much it would cost to reproduce the package by hiring a programmer and paying them a competitive market wage. To estimate this supply-side value ( 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; ) , we take the complete list of OSS packages discussed above, and then count the lines of code in each unique\n\n14 In an alternative version, we use a mixture of a labor and goods market approach that is more closely aligned with Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff, et al (2021). However, applying this method in our setting requires numerous additional assumptions due to data constraints. For simplicity we call it the goods market approach for which we provide the details and statistics, as well as the limitations in Appendix A.\n\npackage. 15 For each unique package,  , we calculate the value and then sum over all these values i to obtain the total value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nIn this calculation, we implicitly do not incorporate any production externalities since we assume that there is no spillover knowledge from one package to the next that would lower the cost of programming. 16 This methodology is similar to that used by other papers that estimate the supply-side costs of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021).\n\nWe then calculate the demand-side value of OSS by incorporating the usage information ( Q) for each package:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nHere, we do not incorporate consumption externalities, i.e., we do not allow a benefit to arise for the general public when a package has been created and we further make sure that each firm is only replacing a package they use once, since a replaced package can be used within a firm as a club good (e.g., see Cornes and Sandler, 1996). The value 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost to rewrite all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the concept of OSS still exists, but all of these packages needed to be rewritten from scratch), while the value 𝑉 + \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost for each firm that uses one of these OSS packages to pay a developer to rewrite those packages (e.g., OSS itself no longer exists).\n\nFor both the supply and demand models, we obtain the dollar-value for each package ( 𝑃 ( ) via the Constructive Cost Model II, also abbreviated as COCOMO II (Boehm 1984, Boehm et al. 2009). The model has previously been used by the United States Department of Defense to estimate software project costs as well as in prior research estimating the value of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021). It is a highly flexible model that allows us to create non-linear transformations of lines of code to dollar-values. It uses the following modelling equation:\n\n15 We use only the pure lines of code excluding documentation lines and empty lines. Hence, we underestimate the true value of recreating each package.\n\n16 Similar to a representative agent model (e.g. see Williamson 2006), one may think of each package being reproduced by separate programmers who are identical replicas of each other (and therefore have the same skill level, but do not become more efficient via learning).\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n( (\n\nwhere 𝐿 represents the lines of codes in thousands and E the effort in person-month units for each project  . Consistent with Blind et al. (2021), we use the default parameter values for i 𝛼 , 𝛽 and 𝜂. The parameters 𝛼 𝛽 , are non-linear adjustment factors set to 2.94, and 1.0997 respectively . The parameter 𝜂 is an effort-adjustment factor which can be modified to incorporate subjective assessments of product, hardware, personnel, and project attributes. Since we do not have a prior for each project, we set 𝜂 to the default value of one. To obtain the price ( 𝑃 ( ) of each OSS project, we  then  multiply  the  results  of  equation  (3)  by  the  weighted  global  wage  that  an  average programmer would obtain on the open market. To calculate a global wage, we include the base monthly salaries of software developers from Salary Expert for the top 30 countries in terms of their GitHub developer counts in 2021 (Wachs et al., 2022). 17 The weight of each country is its share of active GitHub contributors over the total contributors in the top 30 countries. We further create bounds by using a low-wage (India) and high-wage (USA) labor market for the wage to better understand how the value would vary by the pool of programmers used to recreate all of OSS. 18\n\nDocument 11: ## 4. Results\n\nAfter applying the labor market approach using COCOMO II, we obtain global estimates for the value of OSS. To calculate the overall value, we first need the underlying number of lines of code (to calculate the supply-side value) and then the usage statistics (for the demand-side value). Since there may be substantial heterogeneity in value by programming languages, we also show the top programming languages during our investigation period in the year 2020, as discussed above.\n\nDocument 21: ## Appendix A) Goods-Market Valuation Approach\n\nAs an alternate estimation method, instead of using the labor replacement cost, we use a goods replacement value approach. We identify several OSS packages that have similar closed-source, pecuniary alternatives and consider the costs if all commercial users of the free OSS had to replace that software with a pecuniary alternative (similar to the calculations Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) performed for web servers). We can then use this alternate value of p , combined with the q values from above to estimate a goods replacement value of OSS. This method builds on suggestions from Nordhaus (2006, p. 146) who says '…the price of market and nonmarket goods and services should be imputed on the basis of the comparable market goods and services.' We do not expect the estimates from the two methods to be similar. Quite the contrary, the value of those two methods varies substantially since the latter goods-market approach assumes a fixed price to sell a good multiple times and that fixed price is usually lower than the total value estimated from recreating all packages on the labor side. The differential between these estimates is  essentially the result of a firm stepping in to reproduce the missing OSS packages and then selling them for a pecuniary price rather than all firms needing to reproduce those packages from scratch themselves.\n\nWith the goods market approach, the thought experiment is still that we live in a world where OSS does not exist, but it has to be recreated via one firm that then charges a price for a good that is currently free. To value OSS via the goods market approach, we created a basket of equivalent substitute proprietary goods that are priced on the open market as a stand-in for an OSS product.  This  methodology  is  consistent  with  that  used  in  the  prior  literature  (Greenstein  and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021) although both of those studies only used a single good rather than a basket since they were focused on only one type of OSS (web servers). Since there is no readily available database for proprietary equivalents of OSS, we conduct a search based on subjective  perception  of  popularity  of  OSS  and  we  then  search  for  pecuniary,  closed-source substitutes for them. The resulting basket of 20 OSS packages with proprietary substitutes is a good representation of the diversity of OSS. The software ranges from media and design software to statistical analysis programs, to database management and web server software. 21\n\n21 Table A5 shows the basket of OSS and their proprietary equivalents that we used. To create this basket, we looked for proprietary software that had an OSS equivalent that was similar in its overall function and feature set, and sought to identify pairs of software that, in aggregate, captured a broad and representative set of the types of OSS that exist.\n\nBased on our OSS equivalent substitute proprietary goods basket we then obtain prices for each proprietary software equivalent and we calculated the COCOMO labor market supply-side value for each OSS product in the basket which we use as a proxy - for lack of the code from the proprietary software - for the COCOMO labor supply side value of the proprietary software (e.g., the cost it would take to pay a programmer to write that proprietary software from scratch). We then calculate the average COCOMO labor supply-side value of the basket, 𝑉 !,1#23.4 ,  and  the average price for the basket, 𝑃 !,1#23.4 . 22 Since, we know the labor market supply-side value of all OSS, 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; , we can setup the following equation and obtain the price of OSS, 𝑃 ! for the goodsmarket for all OSS via a simple scaling transformation:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nThis results in the following goods-market supply-side value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nWe can then obtain the equivalent demand-side goods-market values as follows:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nFrom the goods market side, we consider the equivalent price that a firm would charge if it produced all existing widely used OSS and then sold it as a product to customers.\n\nTable A6, column 3 shows that the value on the demand side ranges between $177 million and $244 million across the different buckets independent of the country of origin from which programmers are hired. Naturally, the goods-market value will be substantially smaller than the labor demand value since this imaginary firm will make a profit at a comparatively low price by producing the software once and then selling it to many customers. Further, while Greenstein and Nagle (2014) as well as Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) focus on one particular type of software only (web servers), we attempt to expand on their approach to many goods. However, the data limitations become a stronger constraint in this context which makes it inherently more difficult\n\n22 We obtained the average price of the goods-market proprietary basket by using a 3 years lifespan of software, i.e. 1\/(1-0.66), so the depreciation factor is 0.33. This is consistent with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules for depreciating software, which states 'If you can depreciate the cost of computer software, use the straight line method over a useful life of 36 months.' https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/publications\/p946#en\\_US\\_2022\\_publink1000107354.\n\nto  estimate  the  value  through  this  approach  while  requiring  substantially  more  assumptions. Instead of a pure goods-market approach, this requires assistance from the labor-market approach in terms of scaling for the estimate, which ultimately leads to a substantial underestimate of the value of OSS. Further, the pricing strategy of the proprietary software counterparts is sensitive to the  market  demand.  With  the  goods-market  approach  extending  to  multiple  goods,  the  strong implicit assumption is that the market demands for our basket software and our sample OSS are similar, so they lead to commensurate prices.\n\nAn alternative and even more simplified goods-market back-of-the-envelope calculation that does not account for lines of code and relies on no scaling from the labor market approach would simply be to multiply a price of a reference good with the usage. We can take the minimum, average, and maximum prices of the basket of proprietary goods as captured in the reference price vector p = (69.99, 1610.17, 5800) and simply multiply it with usage from the combined Census and BuiltWith sample (Table 1). Based on those imputed proprietary price assumptions, the goods market demand side value would range from $0.2 - $16.5 trillion (minimum price - maximum price)  with  the  mean  price  resulting  in  a  value  estimate  of  $4.5  trillion.  However,  while  this estimate creates slightly more variance than the labor market approach, it is inherently flawed by simply assuming that the imputed prices are identical for each open source product based on the reference price. We further think this very simple back-of-the-envelope is an orange to apples comparison since the goods in our basket are fully functional, stand-alone software packages, while the packages in the Census and BuiltWith datasets are comprised of application libraries, which are generally smaller than such stand-alone packages.\n\nGiven all the complexities and assumptions one has to make due to lack of data for a goodsmarket approach, we place stronger emphasis on the labor cost approach highlighted in the main body but we include this method here for completeness.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"simple","seed_document_id":8,"topic":"Others"}}

A pool of programmers across the globe could recreate all of OSS that is being widely used for a cost of approximately $8.80 trillion.","reference_context":"Document 13: ## --- Figure 1 about here ---\n\nFigure 1 shows the heterogeneity of the value of OSS across the top programming languages. Panel A shows the supply side value with the labor value being displayed on the vertical axis. We find that OSS packages created in Go have the highest value with $803 million in value that would have to be created from scratch if the OSS packages did not exist. Go is closely followed by JavaScript  and  Java  with  $758  million  and  $658  million,  respectively.  The  value  of  C  and Typescript is $406 million and $317 million, respectively, while Python has the lowest value of the top languages with around $55 million. JavaScript is not only the top language on GitHub since at least 2014 (GitHub, 2022) it is also the language with one of the highest values in our data. In contrast, Python became more popular over time moving up from the number four spot to the number two language being used in 2020 across all OSS packages on GitHub, while it is in the last spot of our top languages.\n\nPanel B shows the demand side value across the top programming languages. Based on usage generated value, Go is more than four times the value of the next language, JavaScript.\n\nTypescript (a language that extends JavaScript) has seen immense growth rising from the tenth spot of the top 10 languages in 2017 to the fourth spot in 2020 which is also reflected in our data with  Typescript  being  the  third  most  important  language  on  the  demand  side.  The  two  web languages are followed by C and far behind are Java, and Python.\n\nDocument 14: ## --- Figure 2 about here ---\n\nFigure 2 splits the OSS value estimates for each language by our inward facing (Census) and outward facing (BuiltWith) data sources. Panel A and Panel B focus on the supply and demand side estimation for the Census. We obtain a similar pattern that has been established already in the aggregate when pooling both data sources (Figure 1) albeit the impact of JavaScript is substantially lower.  On  the  supply  side  of  the  Census  in  Panel  A,  Java  has  the  second-highest  value  while JavaScript  code  from  the  Census  contributes  to  a  substantially  lower  value  to  the  aggregate. Similarly, the supply side values of C, Python, and Typescript are mainly driven by the Census. From the demand side Panel B we find that Go is the most popular language for inward facing code while all other languages appear to be negligible in relative terms.\n\nFigure 2, Panel C and Panel D show the supply and demand side values for the BuiltWith dataset. The supply side value in Panel C clearly indicates that the value from the BuiltWith sample is driven by JavaScript code, which is a good sanity check since we focused on JavaScript packages to proxy for OSS in the BuiltWith sample, as discussed above. The second highest value is created by TypeScript which is reassuring since it is a superset of JavaScript. Panel D shows a similar pattern  on  the  usage  side  where  most  of  the  value  arises  from  JavaScript  while  TypeScript  is trailing at the second spot as well. The other languages contribute only marginal amounts to the supply and demand side values. Overall, these findings are broadly consistent with the main use cases of the various languages (web programming vs. application programming) and an idea that languages through which value are generated are not necessarily identical to languages that are used by the general public.\n\n--- Figure 3 about here ---\n\nFigure 3 shows the demand-side value of OSS across industries by NAICS 2-digit codes using the BuiltWith online data. 20 This can be interpreted as the value each of these industries receive because OSS exists. The industry with the highest usage value of around $43 billion is 'Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.' 'Retail Trade' as well as 'Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services' make up another large part of the demand-side externally facing value of OSS with $36 billion and $35 billion, respectively. In contrast, industries that constitute just a small portion of the value are 'Mining, Quarrying, and Oil  and  Gas  Extraction',  'Utilities',  'Agriculture,  Forestry,  Fishing,  and  Hunting.'  The  latter industries are classical non-service sector industries and as such software is expected to play less of a role there.\n\nDocument 12: ## --- Table 1 about here ---\n\nTable  1  shows  descriptive  statistics  from  both  data  sets  separately.  The  inward-facing Census  (Panel  A)  contains  just  over  261.7  million  lines  of  code  with  72%  of  the  lines  being attributable to the top programming languages. The average package includes 142 thousand lines of code with a slightly lower average of 113 thousand lines of code for the subset of top languages. When considering the demand (usage) side, we observe that the Census packages were used over 2.7 million times while 92% of this usage is attributable to the top languages. The average package was used 1,472.4 times with a higher usage of around 1,497.5 for the top  languages.  For  the outward-facing  BuiltWith  data  we  find  similar  patterns,  but  at  different  levels.  The  packages included from BuiltWith include over 82 million lines of code, 71% of which are attributable to the  top  programming  languages.  The  average  package  within  the  BuiltWith  sample  has  111 thousand  lines  of  code  with  a  lower  average  of  around  80  thousand  lines  of  code  for  the  top languages. This is because our BuiltWith data primarily consists of JavaScript-based packages, which are often smaller than packages written in other languages. BuiltWith packages were used over 142 thousand times where 99.97% were attributable to the top languages. Next, we used these raw observations to calculate the value of all OSS through the labor market approach and estimated the value created from the supply and demand side.\n\n--- Table 2 about here ---\n\nTable 2 shows the estimates for the value of OSS based on the firm-relevant joint Census and BuiltWith sample. All estimates in Table 2 are based only on software languages classified in bucket  1  from  Table  A1,  which  are  the  most  likely  to  be  written  by  a  human  rather  than  a machine. 19 The first column contains estimates with wages from a low income country (India), the global  average  wage,  and  a  high  income  country  (United  States  of  America),  respectively  (as described above). To reproduce all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the idea of OSS still exists, but all current OSS is deleted and needs to be coded from scratch), using programmers at the average developer wage from India, it would require an investment of $1.22 billion. In contrast, if we use the average developer wage from the United States, then reproducing all widely-used OSS would require  an  investment  of  $6.22  billion.  Using  a  pool  of  programmers  from  across  the  world, weighed based on the existing geographic contributions to OSS as discussed above, would lead to an investment somewhere in between the low and high-income country, $4.15 billion. It is useful to compare these numbers to those from similar studies to understand differences in valuing all OSS (prior studies) versus that which is widely used (our study). Robbins et al. (2021) and Blind et al. (2021) use a method similar to ours and estimate that the value of OSS created in the US is $38 billion in 2019 and that created in the EU is €1 billion in 2018. Wachs et al. (2022) show that roughly 50% of OSS contributions come from the US and EU combined. In aggregate, that would lead these studies to give a global value of OSS of $78 billion. Thus, our middle estimate of a supply-side value of $4.15 billion for only firm-oriented and widely used OSS is a credible lowerbound and highlights the higher estimations of the total of supply-side value of OSS when not considering whether or not a given OSS package is widely used. This further indicates that the supply-side value of the most widely used OSS is roughly 5.5% of the supply-side value of all OSS.\n\nThe second column in Table 2 contains the demand side estimates based on the labor market approach. We find that if firms had to recreate all OSS packages they used (e.g., OSS itself no longer existed and every firm that used an OSS package had to recreate it), then the entire cost would amount to between $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion using labor from the low wage or high wage country only, respectively. A pool of programmers across the globe could recreate all of OSS that is being widely used for a cost of approximately $8.80 trillion. Interpreting this number is\n\n19 Tables in the appendix show the equivalent values from Table 2 when including software language buckets 1 and 2 (Table A3) and all three software language buckets (Table A4).\n\nslightly more complicated but still feasible. According to a Statista (2023) report, global software revenue in 2020 (the same year as our data) was $531.7 billion. However, this represents a flow, not a stock, of software. Relying on government estimates that software fully depreciates over three years, we can do a back of the envelope calculation and consider the purchase value of the full stock of prepackaged software used in 2020 as the aggregate of that sold from 2018 to 2020, which is $1.54 trillion. Further, this represents only the expenditure on prepackaged software and does  not  include  custom  purchased  or  in-house  developed  software.  Here,  the  best  obtainable estimates of private-sector investment in software overall come from the United States National Income and Product Accounts data (NIPA 2023). In 2020, the national account data shows that in the  US,  private  firms  spent  $479.2  billion  on  software,  of  which  45%  ($215.5  billion)  was prepackaged. If we assume this is a consistent ratio for the rest of the world, then the total amount firms spent on software being used in 2020 was $3.4 trillion (= $1.54 trillion\/0.45). Combining this rough estimate with the demand side estimate of the value of OSS based on an average global wage ($8.8 trillion), this indicates firms would spend $12.2 trillion (=$3.4 trillion + $8.8 trillion), or three and a half times what they currently spend if they needed to pay in-house developers to write the OSS that they currently use for free.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"complex","seed_document_id":13,"topic":"Others"}}

Introduction\n\nIn 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that 'software is eating the world' (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that 'open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,' (Jacks, 2022). Other recent studies have come to similar conclusions showing that open source software  (OSS)  -  software  whose  source  code  is  publicly  available  for  inspection,  use,  and modification and is often created in a decentralized manner and distributed for free - appears in 96% of codebases (Synopsys 2023), and that some commercial software consists of up to 99.9% freely available OSS (Musseau et al., 2022). Although in its early days OSS frequently copied features from existing proprietary software, OSS today includes cutting edge technology in various fields including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, big data, and analytics.  However, despite the increasing importance of OSS to all software (and therefore to the entire economy), measuring its impact has been elusive. Traditionally, to measure the value created by a good or service,  economists  multiply  the  price  ( p )  times  the  quantity  sold  ( q ).  However,  in  OSS, p is generally zero since the source code is publicly available, and q is  unknown due to the limited number of restrictions around how the code may be copied and reused. For example, if a company downloads  a  piece  of  OSS  from  a  public  code  repository,  it  may  copy  it  thousands  of  times internally (legally) and then share it with suppliers or customers (also legally), so public download data is insufficient. Although some recent studies have sought to estimate the value of p (discussed below), data for estimating q has been unavailable or intractable for anything more than just a handful of OSS packages. Using newly collected data from multiple sources, the goal of this paper is to provide estimates for both p and q and to use those to shine light on the question: What is the value of open source software?\n\nUnderstanding the value of OSS is of critical importance not only due to the role it plays in the economy, but also due to it being one of the most successful and impactful modern examples of the centuries old economic concept of 'the commons' which run the risk of meeting the fate known as 'the tragedy of the commons.' This concept can trace its roots as far back as the 4 th -century BC philosopher Aristotle who wrote 'That which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care. Men pay most attention to what is their own and care less for what is common.'  (Aristotle,  1981).  William  Forster  Lloyd  (1833)  resurfaced  the  idea  in  modern economic thought by highlighting the example of shared tracts of land used for cattle grazing by\n\nmultiple cattle herders who each had an incentive to overuse the shared resource. Garrett Hardin (1968)  brought  the  concept  into  the  broader  zeitgeist  when  he  wrote  an  article  discussing  the problem entitled 'The Tragedy of the Commons.' Building on this work, Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for her research highlighting paths to avoiding the tragedy of the commons through community coordination efforts that did not necessitate government enforced laws to manage and guard the commons (Ostrom 1990). The parallels between shared grazing lands and shared digital infrastructure are palpable - the availability of communal grass to feed cattle, and in turn feed people, was critical to the agrarian economy, and the ability to not have to recreate code that someone else has already written is critical to the modern economy. Further, in both contexts, despite knowing grass and code are critical inputs to the economy, measuring their actual value is difficult. And, as the renowned mathematician and physicist Lord Kelvin is believed to have said, 'If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.' And if you cannot improve and maintain it, such common goods may crumble under the weight of their own success as they are overused, but underinvested in (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021). Therefore, measuring the value OSS creates is crucial to the future health of the digital economy, and the rest of the economy that is built on top of it.\n\nImportantly, recent studies have attempted to address these measurement issues but fall short of capturing both the breadth and depth of OSS usage - a gap we seek to fill with this paper. For example, researchers have attempted to gain breadth by using novel methodologies to estimate the labor replacement value of the current corpus of OSS created in the United States at $38 billion in 2019 (Robbins et al., 2021) and that created in the European Union at €1 billion (Blind et al., 2021) by imputing the labor costs that it would have taken to rewrite existing OSS. Such efforts do a very good job at estimating what it would cost to replace all existing OSS if it disappeared tomorrow. However, the resultant estimates rely on two important assumptions. First, that all OSS is equally valuable from a usage standpoint, and second that the concept of OSS would still exist, and society would just need to rewrite the code once, thus addressing the aforementioned problem of a missing value for p , but not addressing the missing value of q . In a world where OSS did not exist at all, then each piece of OSS software would not need to be rewritten just once, but instead would need to be rewritten by every firm that used the software (assuming the firm could freely share the software within its boundaries). Other research (Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; MurcianoGoroff, Zhuo, and Greenstein, 2021) has gone deeper into this hypothetical, albeit in a narrow\n\nmanner, by only focusing on web servers (which are public facing on the Internet and can therefore be readily measured). Using different methods, both studies measure q for this one type of software and impute p by using a goods replacement value approach based on the prices for closed-source alternatives offered by firms. With data from the United States the resulting estimates show a value of  $2  billion  for  the  OSS  Apache  Web  Server  in  2012  (Greenstein  and  Nagle,  2014)  and  a combined value of $4.5 billion for Apache and the increasingly popular OSS web server nginx in 2018 (Murciano-Goroff, et al., 2021). However, although web servers are an important part of the OSS  ecosystem,  they  constitute  a  small  portion  of  it.  We  seek  to  build  upon  the  important contributions this existing research has made in an attempt to go both broad and deep to create a more complete measure of the value of OSS.\n\nTo consider the value of OSS in both a broad and deep manner, we use data from two primary sources that allow us to gain insights into the OSS used at tens of thousands of firms across the world. The first is the 'Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries' (Nagle et al., 2022). The Census II project utilized partnerships with multiple software composition analysis (SCA) firms to create various lists of the most widely used OSS. SCAs are hired to scan the codebases of a company to ensure they are not violating any OSS licenses and, as a byproduct, track all the OSS code used by their customers and the products they build. The Census II project aggregated data from multiple SCAs to build a dataset of OSS usage at tens of thousands of firms based  on  millions  of  data  points  (observations  of  OSS  usage).  The  second  data  source  is  the BuiltWith dataset, from which we leverage scans of nearly nine million websites to identify the underlying technology deployed by these websites, including OSS libraries. The BuiltWith data has been used in multiple academic studies (DeStefano &amp; Timmis 2023, Dushnitsky &amp; Stroube 2021, Koning et al.. 2022), but to our knowledge this is the first one to focus on OSS usage. The Census II data and the BuiltWith data are complementary as the former focuses on OSS that is built  into  the  software  a  company  sells,  while  the  latter  focuses  on  OSS  that  is  built  into  a company's website, thus reducing the chances of double-counting observations across the datasets. In aggregate, these two datasets combined create the most complete measurement of OSS usage ( q ) to date. Further, by focusing on OSS that is widely deployed and used by firms, rather than considering all the projects that exist in an OSS repository, we enhance the methodologies of prior studies by reducing the likelihood of measurement error stemming from projects that are posted as publicly available OSS but are not actually used in any practical manner. Not accounting for this\n\nmeasurement error would lead to overestimation of the actual value of OSS as projects that are widely used would be valued in the same way as projects that are not used at all.\n\nTo estimate p ,  we  follow  the  literature  discussed  above  and  use  the  labor  replacement value. First, we calculate the labor cost it would take an individual firm to recreate a given OSS package by measuring the number of lines of code within the package and then applying the Constructive Cost Model II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) - also known as COCOMO II to estimate the number of person-hours it would take to write the code from scratch. We then utilize global wage data from Salary Expert to get an accurate estimate of the labor costs a firm would incur if this piece of OSS did not exist. These costs can be combined with the q values from above at the OSS package level to estimate the combined value of all OSS from both the supply and demand sides.\n\nWe find a value ranging from $1.22 billion to $6.22 billion if we were to decide as a society to recreate all widely used OSS on the supply side. However, considering the actual usage of OSS leads to a demand-side value that is orders of magnitude larger and ranges from $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion, if each firm who used an OSS package had to recreate it from scratch (e.g., the concept of OSS did not exist). We document substantial heterogeneity of the value of OSS by programming  language  and  internal  vs  outward-facing  programming  efforts.  Further,  we  find considerable  heterogeneity  in  value  contributions  by  programmers  as  5%  of  programmers  are responsible for more than 90% of the value created on the supply- and demand- side. The data we use is arguably the most comprehensive source of data to measure the value created by firm usage of OSS at this time. However, as for any project, the evidence is not complete and we argue that we underestimate the value since our data, e.g., does not include operating systems, which are a substantial omitted category of OSS.\n\nThis study makes four important contributions to the academic literature, practitioners, and policy makers. First, it provides the most complete estimate of the value of widely used OSS to date  by  accounting  for  not  only  the  supply-side  of  OSS  (price  to  create  it),  but  also  for  the usage\/demand-side at a scale that has not been done before. While prior estimates of the value of OSS only went either broad (estimating the supply-side costs of a large swath of OSS) or deep (estimating the value created by one particular type of OSS), this study does both by using unique datasets that allow for a better understanding of the breadth and depth of OSS usage. Further, rather than measuring the value of all OSS, this study focuses on the value of OSS that is used by firms\n\nto create its products and websites, limiting the measurement error occurring in studies that are unable to account for which OSS is actually used in production. This contribution builds upon, and extends, important research (e.g., Blind et al., 2021; Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021; Robbins et al., 2021) that has sought to identify the value of this vital resource that contributes a great deal to the modern economy despite the difficulties measuring this contribution. In  doing  so,  it  adds  insights  to  a  long-running  discussion  related  to  the  impact  of  information technology (IT) on productivity (Brynjolfsson, 1993; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 1996; Nagle, 2019a; Solow, 1987) known as the 'productivity paradox' where IT investments can have limited impact on productivity statistics. This debate has continued into the emerging context of AI (Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson, 2018). Our work contributes to this conversation by highlighting a massive societal level cost-savings (and hence productivity enhancement) that is created by the existence of OSS.\n\nSecond, our research contributes methodological advances to the study of intangible capital by highlighting novel sources of data related to investments in OSS. Prior research has shown that intangible capital plays an increasingly important role in economic growth (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel,  2009)  and  firm  value  (Peters  and  Taylor,  2017),  but  it  often  goes  unmeasured  or misattributed (Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou, 2014). Further, we demonstrate how these data sources can be used to understand the true investments in software that a firm makes, and that which they would have to make if OSS did not exist.  This  is  valuable  as  investments  in  software  are  an increasingly important type of intangible capital that is driving innovation (Branstetter, Drev, and Kwon, 2019) and performance (Krishnan et al., 2000).\n\nThird, our results help highlight for firms and managers the importance of OSS to their production, and ideally add weight to arguments that users of OSS should not just free ride but also contribute to the creation and maintenance of OSS (e.g., Henkel, 2008; Nagle, 2018). Such contributions are a fraction of the costs that firms would incur if OSS did not exist and the active participation of OSS users in helping maintain the OSS they use is critical to the health and future well-being of the OSS ecosystem (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021; Zhang et al., 2019).\n\nFourth,  and  finally,  our  study  helps  inform  policymakers  who  have  recently  started  to understand  the  growing  importance  of  OSS  to  the  economy  and  taken  actions  to  support  the ecosystem (European Commission, 2020; Executive Order No. 14028, 2021). However, most of these efforts are related to securing the existing OSS ecosystem, which is quite important, but do\n\nnot go as far as supporting the creation of new OSS. Our results help shine light on the importance of OSS to the overall economy and add weight to calls for more societal support of this critical resource. Our results further show that the majority of the value created by OSS is created by a small  number  of  contributors.  Although  it  has  long  been  known  that  a  small  number  of  OSS contributors do most of the work, we add new insights that show this is even more true for the value creation of widely-used OSS projects and that societal support for these individuals is critical to the future success of OSS, and in turn, the economy.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the empirical setting and data. Section 3 discusses the methods including measurement challenges. In section 4, we estimate the value of open source software.

{"id":"32654866-7ccc-4a30-beaf-4a8d7f5f8f71","question":"In the context of the Harvard Business School's OSS report, what are the specific constraints and assumptions associated with the goods-market valuation approach, particularly regarding the estimation of OSS value when proprietary equivalents are used as substitutes?","reference_answer":"The goods-market valuation approach estimates the value of OSS by considering the costs if all commercial users of free OSS had to replace that software with pecuniary alternatives. This method involves creating a basket of equivalent substitute proprietary goods priced on the open market as a stand-in for an OSS product. It is based on the assumption that a firm reproduces the missing OSS packages and sells them for a pecuniary price, rather than all firms needing to reproduce those packages from scratch themselves.","reference_context":"Document 21: ## Appendix A) Goods-Market Valuation Approach\n\nAs an alternate estimation method, instead of using the labor replacement cost, we use a goods replacement value approach. We identify several OSS packages that have similar closed-source, pecuniary alternatives and consider the costs if all commercial users of the free OSS had to replace that software with a pecuniary alternative (similar to the calculations Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) performed for web servers). We can then use this alternate value of p , combined with the q values from above to estimate a goods replacement value of OSS. This method builds on suggestions from Nordhaus (2006, p. 146) who says '…the price of market and nonmarket goods and services should be imputed on the basis of the comparable market goods and services.' We do not expect the estimates from the two methods to be similar. Quite the contrary, the value of those two methods varies substantially since the latter goods-market approach assumes a fixed price to sell a good multiple times and that fixed price is usually lower than the total value estimated from recreating all packages on the labor side. The differential between these estimates is  essentially the result of a firm stepping in to reproduce the missing OSS packages and then selling them for a pecuniary price rather than all firms needing to reproduce those packages from scratch themselves.\n\nWith the goods market approach, the thought experiment is still that we live in a world where OSS does not exist, but it has to be recreated via one firm that then charges a price for a good that is currently free. To value OSS via the goods market approach, we created a basket of equivalent substitute proprietary goods that are priced on the open market as a stand-in for an OSS product.  This  methodology  is  consistent  with  that  used  in  the  prior  literature  (Greenstein  and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021) although both of those studies only used a single good rather than a basket since they were focused on only one type of OSS (web servers). Since there is no readily available database for proprietary equivalents of OSS, we conduct a search based on subjective  perception  of  popularity  of  OSS  and  we  then  search  for  pecuniary,  closed-source substitutes for them. The resulting basket of 20 OSS packages with proprietary substitutes is a good representation of the diversity of OSS. The software ranges from media and design software to statistical analysis programs, to database management and web server software. 21\n\n21 Table A5 shows the basket of OSS and their proprietary equivalents that we used. To create this basket, we looked for proprietary software that had an OSS equivalent that was similar in its overall function and feature set, and sought to identify pairs of software that, in aggregate, captured a broad and representative set of the types of OSS that exist.\n\nBased on our OSS equivalent substitute proprietary goods basket we then obtain prices for each proprietary software equivalent and we calculated the COCOMO labor market supply-side value for each OSS product in the basket which we use as a proxy - for lack of the code from the proprietary software - for the COCOMO labor supply side value of the proprietary software (e.g., the cost it would take to pay a programmer to write that proprietary software from scratch). We then calculate the average COCOMO labor supply-side value of the basket, 𝑉 !,1#23.4 ,  and  the average price for the basket, 𝑃 !,1#23.4 . 22 Since, we know the labor market supply-side value of all OSS, 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; , we can setup the following equation and obtain the price of OSS, 𝑃 ! for the goodsmarket for all OSS via a simple scaling transformation:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nThis results in the following goods-market supply-side value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nWe can then obtain the equivalent demand-side goods-market values as follows:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nFrom the goods market side, we consider the equivalent price that a firm would charge if it produced all existing widely used OSS and then sold it as a product to customers.\n\nTable A6, column 3 shows that the value on the demand side ranges between $177 million and $244 million across the different buckets independent of the country of origin from which programmers are hired. Naturally, the goods-market value will be substantially smaller than the labor demand value since this imaginary firm will make a profit at a comparatively low price by producing the software once and then selling it to many customers. Further, while Greenstein and Nagle (2014) as well as Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) focus on one particular type of software only (web servers), we attempt to expand on their approach to many goods. However, the data limitations become a stronger constraint in this context which makes it inherently more difficult\n\n22 We obtained the average price of the goods-market proprietary basket by using a 3 years lifespan of software, i.e. 1\/(1-0.66), so the depreciation factor is 0.33. This is consistent with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules for depreciating software, which states 'If you can depreciate the cost of computer software, use the straight line method over a useful life of 36 months.' https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/publications\/p946#en\\_US\\_2022\\_publink1000107354.\n\nto  estimate  the  value  through  this  approach  while  requiring  substantially  more  assumptions. Instead of a pure goods-market approach, this requires assistance from the labor-market approach in terms of scaling for the estimate, which ultimately leads to a substantial underestimate of the value of OSS. Further, the pricing strategy of the proprietary software counterparts is sensitive to the  market  demand.  With  the  goods-market  approach  extending  to  multiple  goods,  the  strong implicit assumption is that the market demands for our basket software and our sample OSS are similar, so they lead to commensurate prices.\n\nAn alternative and even more simplified goods-market back-of-the-envelope calculation that does not account for lines of code and relies on no scaling from the labor market approach would simply be to multiply a price of a reference good with the usage. We can take the minimum, average, and maximum prices of the basket of proprietary goods as captured in the reference price vector p = (69.99, 1610.17, 5800) and simply multiply it with usage from the combined Census and BuiltWith sample (Table 1). Based on those imputed proprietary price assumptions, the goods market demand side value would range from $0.2 - $16.5 trillion (minimum price - maximum price)  with  the  mean  price  resulting  in  a  value  estimate  of  $4.5  trillion.  However,  while  this estimate creates slightly more variance than the labor market approach, it is inherently flawed by simply assuming that the imputed prices are identical for each open source product based on the reference price. We further think this very simple back-of-the-envelope is an orange to apples comparison since the goods in our basket are fully functional, stand-alone software packages, while the packages in the Census and BuiltWith datasets are comprised of application libraries, which are generally smaller than such stand-alone packages.\n\nGiven all the complexities and assumptions one has to make due to lack of data for a goodsmarket approach, we place stronger emphasis on the labor cost approach highlighted in the main body but we include this method here for completeness.\n\nDocument 9: ## 3.1 Labor market approach\n\nFor the labor market approach, we estimate the value of OSS by calculating the replacement value of a package. We ask how much it would cost to reproduce the package by hiring a programmer and paying them a competitive market wage. To estimate this supply-side value ( 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; ) , we take the complete list of OSS packages discussed above, and then count the lines of code in each unique\n\n14 In an alternative version, we use a mixture of a labor and goods market approach that is more closely aligned with Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff, et al (2021). However, applying this method in our setting requires numerous additional assumptions due to data constraints. For simplicity we call it the goods market approach for which we provide the details and statistics, as well as the limitations in Appendix A.\n\npackage. 15 For each unique package,  , we calculate the value and then sum over all these values i to obtain the total value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nIn this calculation, we implicitly do not incorporate any production externalities since we assume that there is no spillover knowledge from one package to the next that would lower the cost of programming. 16 This methodology is similar to that used by other papers that estimate the supply-side costs of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021).\n\nWe then calculate the demand-side value of OSS by incorporating the usage information ( Q) for each package:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nHere, we do not incorporate consumption externalities, i.e., we do not allow a benefit to arise for the general public when a package has been created and we further make sure that each firm is only replacing a package they use once, since a replaced package can be used within a firm as a club good (e.g., see Cornes and Sandler, 1996). The value 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost to rewrite all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the concept of OSS still exists, but all of these packages needed to be rewritten from scratch), while the value 𝑉 + \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost for each firm that uses one of these OSS packages to pay a developer to rewrite those packages (e.g., OSS itself no longer exists).\n\nFor both the supply and demand models, we obtain the dollar-value for each package ( 𝑃 ( ) via the Constructive Cost Model II, also abbreviated as COCOMO II (Boehm 1984, Boehm et al. 2009). The model has previously been used by the United States Department of Defense to estimate software project costs as well as in prior research estimating the value of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021). It is a highly flexible model that allows us to create non-linear transformations of lines of code to dollar-values. It uses the following modelling equation:\n\n15 We use only the pure lines of code excluding documentation lines and empty lines. Hence, we underestimate the true value of recreating each package.\n\n16 Similar to a representative agent model (e.g. see Williamson 2006), one may think of each package being reproduced by separate programmers who are identical replicas of each other (and therefore have the same skill level, but do not become more efficient via learning).\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n( (\n\nwhere 𝐿 represents the lines of codes in thousands and E the effort in person-month units for each project  . Consistent with Blind et al. (2021), we use the default parameter values for i 𝛼 , 𝛽 and 𝜂. The parameters 𝛼 𝛽 , are non-linear adjustment factors set to 2.94, and 1.0997 respectively . The parameter 𝜂 is an effort-adjustment factor which can be modified to incorporate subjective assessments of product, hardware, personnel, and project attributes. Since we do not have a prior for each project, we set 𝜂 to the default value of one. To obtain the price ( 𝑃 ( ) of each OSS project, we  then  multiply  the  results  of  equation  (3)  by  the  weighted  global  wage  that  an  average programmer would obtain on the open market. To calculate a global wage, we include the base monthly salaries of software developers from Salary Expert for the top 30 countries in terms of their GitHub developer counts in 2021 (Wachs et al., 2022). 17 The weight of each country is its share of active GitHub contributors over the total contributors in the top 30 countries. We further create bounds by using a low-wage (India) and high-wage (USA) labor market for the wage to better understand how the value would vary by the pool of programmers used to recreate all of OSS. 18\n\nDocument 8: ## 3. Methodology\n\nWe first measure the value of OSS by considering the supply and the demand side of OSS using a labor market approach. 14 The thought experiment is that we live in a world where OSS does not exist and has to be recreated at each firm that uses a given piece of OSS. Using the labor market approach, we calculate the labor replacement cost of each OSS package. To estimate the value for each package, we use COCOMO II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) at the individual package level and then sum across all package values to obtain a supply-side labor market replacement value. Then, we scale the supply-side value by the number of times firms are using each package while removing multi-usage within each firm to obtain a demand-side value.\n\nSecond, we move beyond the aggregate and inspect inequality in the value creation process. In OSS, as with many creative endeavors, it is common that a small handful of individuals provide the bulk of the contributions, while many others make small contributions (sometimes referred to as the 80\/20 rule, implying 80% of the work is done by 20% of the people). Research has shown these frequent contributors often attain positions of influence in OSS communities as a result of their efforts (Hanisch, et al, 2018). Therefore, to better understand the dispersion of value creation across developers, we first use the GHTorrent data and identify individual developer contributions in two ways: a) through their OSS value contributions directly and b) through the total number of repositories they contributed to. We then test how concentrated these two contribution measures are to better understand whether many or few developers contribute to the total value we measure. We explain the exact details for the labor market approach and the inequality of valuations below.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"complex","seed_document_id":21,"topic":"Others"}}

Introduction\n\nIn 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that 'software is eating the world' (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that 'open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,' (Jacks, 2022). Other recent studies have come to similar conclusions showing that open source software  (OSS)  -  software  whose  source  code  is  publicly  available  for  inspection,  use,  and modification and is often created in a decentralized manner and distributed for free - appears in 96% of codebases (Synopsys 2023), and that some commercial software consists of up to 99.9% freely available OSS (Musseau et al., 2022). Although in its early days OSS frequently copied features from existing proprietary software, OSS today includes cutting edge technology in various fields including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, big data, and analytics.  However, despite the increasing importance of OSS to all software (and therefore to the entire economy), measuring its impact has been elusive. Traditionally, to measure the value created by a good or service,  economists  multiply  the  price  ( p )  times  the  quantity  sold  ( q ).  However,  in  OSS, p is generally zero since the source code is publicly available, and q is  unknown due to the limited number of restrictions around how the code may be copied and reused. For example, if a company downloads  a  piece  of  OSS  from  a  public  code  repository,  it  may  copy  it  thousands  of  times internally (legally) and then share it with suppliers or customers (also legally), so public download data is insufficient. Although some recent studies have sought to estimate the value of p (discussed below), data for estimating q has been unavailable or intractable for anything more than just a handful of OSS packages. Using newly collected data from multiple sources, the goal of this paper is to provide estimates for both p and q and to use those to shine light on the question: What is the value of open source software?\n\nUnderstanding the value of OSS is of critical importance not only due to the role it plays in the economy, but also due to it being one of the most successful and impactful modern examples of the centuries old economic concept of 'the commons' which run the risk of meeting the fate known as 'the tragedy of the commons.' This concept can trace its roots as far back as the 4 th -century BC philosopher Aristotle who wrote 'That which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care. Men pay most attention to what is their own and care less for what is common.'  (Aristotle,  1981).  William  Forster  Lloyd  (1833)  resurfaced  the  idea  in  modern economic thought by highlighting the example of shared tracts of land used for cattle grazing by\n\nmultiple cattle herders who each had an incentive to overuse the shared resource. Garrett Hardin (1968)  brought  the  concept  into  the  broader  zeitgeist  when  he  wrote  an  article  discussing  the problem entitled 'The Tragedy of the Commons.' Building on this work, Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for her research highlighting paths to avoiding the tragedy of the commons through community coordination efforts that did not necessitate government enforced laws to manage and guard the commons (Ostrom 1990). The parallels between shared grazing lands and shared digital infrastructure are palpable - the availability of communal grass to feed cattle, and in turn feed people, was critical to the agrarian economy, and the ability to not have to recreate code that someone else has already written is critical to the modern economy. Further, in both contexts, despite knowing grass and code are critical inputs to the economy, measuring their actual value is difficult. And, as the renowned mathematician and physicist Lord Kelvin is believed to have said, 'If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.' And if you cannot improve and maintain it, such common goods may crumble under the weight of their own success as they are overused, but underinvested in (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021). Therefore, measuring the value OSS creates is crucial to the future health of the digital economy, and the rest of the economy that is built on top of it.\n\nImportantly, recent studies have attempted to address these measurement issues but fall short of capturing both the breadth and depth of OSS usage - a gap we seek to fill with this paper. For example, researchers have attempted to gain breadth by using novel methodologies to estimate the labor replacement value of the current corpus of OSS created in the United States at $38 billion in 2019 (Robbins et al., 2021) and that created in the European Union at €1 billion (Blind et al., 2021) by imputing the labor costs that it would have taken to rewrite existing OSS. Such efforts do a very good job at estimating what it would cost to replace all existing OSS if it disappeared tomorrow. However, the resultant estimates rely on two important assumptions. First, that all OSS is equally valuable from a usage standpoint, and second that the concept of OSS would still exist, and society would just need to rewrite the code once, thus addressing the aforementioned problem of a missing value for p , but not addressing the missing value of q . In a world where OSS did not exist at all, then each piece of OSS software would not need to be rewritten just once, but instead would need to be rewritten by every firm that used the software (assuming the firm could freely share the software within its boundaries). Other research (Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; MurcianoGoroff, Zhuo, and Greenstein, 2021) has gone deeper into this hypothetical, albeit in a narrow\n\nmanner, by only focusing on web servers (which are public facing on the Internet and can therefore be readily measured). Using different methods, both studies measure q for this one type of software and impute p by using a goods replacement value approach based on the prices for closed-source alternatives offered by firms. With data from the United States the resulting estimates show a value of  $2  billion  for  the  OSS  Apache  Web  Server  in  2012  (Greenstein  and  Nagle,  2014)  and  a combined value of $4.5 billion for Apache and the increasingly popular OSS web server nginx in 2018 (Murciano-Goroff, et al., 2021). However, although web servers are an important part of the OSS  ecosystem,  they  constitute  a  small  portion  of  it.  We  seek  to  build  upon  the  important contributions this existing research has made in an attempt to go both broad and deep to create a more complete measure of the value of OSS.\n\nTo consider the value of OSS in both a broad and deep manner, we use data from two primary sources that allow us to gain insights into the OSS used at tens of thousands of firms across the world. The first is the 'Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries' (Nagle et al., 2022). The Census II project utilized partnerships with multiple software composition analysis (SCA) firms to create various lists of the most widely used OSS. SCAs are hired to scan the codebases of a company to ensure they are not violating any OSS licenses and, as a byproduct, track all the OSS code used by their customers and the products they build. The Census II project aggregated data from multiple SCAs to build a dataset of OSS usage at tens of thousands of firms based  on  millions  of  data  points  (observations  of  OSS  usage).  The  second  data  source  is  the BuiltWith dataset, from which we leverage scans of nearly nine million websites to identify the underlying technology deployed by these websites, including OSS libraries. The BuiltWith data has been used in multiple academic studies (DeStefano &amp; Timmis 2023, Dushnitsky &amp; Stroube 2021, Koning et al.. 2022), but to our knowledge this is the first one to focus on OSS usage. The Census II data and the BuiltWith data are complementary as the former focuses on OSS that is built  into  the  software  a  company  sells,  while  the  latter  focuses  on  OSS  that  is  built  into  a company's website, thus reducing the chances of double-counting observations across the datasets. In aggregate, these two datasets combined create the most complete measurement of OSS usage ( q ) to date. Further, by focusing on OSS that is widely deployed and used by firms, rather than considering all the projects that exist in an OSS repository, we enhance the methodologies of prior studies by reducing the likelihood of measurement error stemming from projects that are posted as publicly available OSS but are not actually used in any practical manner. Not accounting for this\n\nmeasurement error would lead to overestimation of the actual value of OSS as projects that are widely used would be valued in the same way as projects that are not used at all.\n\nTo estimate p ,  we  follow  the  literature  discussed  above  and  use  the  labor  replacement value. First, we calculate the labor cost it would take an individual firm to recreate a given OSS package by measuring the number of lines of code within the package and then applying the Constructive Cost Model II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) - also known as COCOMO II to estimate the number of person-hours it would take to write the code from scratch. We then utilize global wage data from Salary Expert to get an accurate estimate of the labor costs a firm would incur if this piece of OSS did not exist. These costs can be combined with the q values from above at the OSS package level to estimate the combined value of all OSS from both the supply and demand sides.\n\nWe find a value ranging from $1.22 billion to $6.22 billion if we were to decide as a society to recreate all widely used OSS on the supply side. However, considering the actual usage of OSS leads to a demand-side value that is orders of magnitude larger and ranges from $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion, if each firm who used an OSS package had to recreate it from scratch (e.g., the concept of OSS did not exist). We document substantial heterogeneity of the value of OSS by programming  language  and  internal  vs  outward-facing  programming  efforts.  Further,  we  find considerable  heterogeneity  in  value  contributions  by  programmers  as  5%  of  programmers  are responsible for more than 90% of the value created on the supply- and demand- side. The data we use is arguably the most comprehensive source of data to measure the value created by firm usage of OSS at this time. However, as for any project, the evidence is not complete and we argue that we underestimate the value since our data, e.g., does not include operating systems, which are a substantial omitted category of OSS.\n\nThis study makes four important contributions to the academic literature, practitioners, and policy makers. First, it provides the most complete estimate of the value of widely used OSS to date  by  accounting  for  not  only  the  supply-side  of  OSS  (price  to  create  it),  but  also  for  the usage\/demand-side at a scale that has not been done before. While prior estimates of the value of OSS only went either broad (estimating the supply-side costs of a large swath of OSS) or deep (estimating the value created by one particular type of OSS), this study does both by using unique datasets that allow for a better understanding of the breadth and depth of OSS usage. Further, rather than measuring the value of all OSS, this study focuses on the value of OSS that is used by firms\n\nto create its products and websites, limiting the measurement error occurring in studies that are unable to account for which OSS is actually used in production. This contribution builds upon, and extends, important research (e.g., Blind et al., 2021; Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021; Robbins et al., 2021) that has sought to identify the value of this vital resource that contributes a great deal to the modern economy despite the difficulties measuring this contribution. In  doing  so,  it  adds  insights  to  a  long-running  discussion  related  to  the  impact  of  information technology (IT) on productivity (Brynjolfsson, 1993; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 1996; Nagle, 2019a; Solow, 1987) known as the 'productivity paradox' where IT investments can have limited impact on productivity statistics. This debate has continued into the emerging context of AI (Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson, 2018). Our work contributes to this conversation by highlighting a massive societal level cost-savings (and hence productivity enhancement) that is created by the existence of OSS.\n\nSecond, our research contributes methodological advances to the study of intangible capital by highlighting novel sources of data related to investments in OSS. Prior research has shown that intangible capital plays an increasingly important role in economic growth (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel,  2009)  and  firm  value  (Peters  and  Taylor,  2017),  but  it  often  goes  unmeasured  or misattributed (Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou, 2014). Further, we demonstrate how these data sources can be used to understand the true investments in software that a firm makes, and that which they would have to make if OSS did not exist.  This  is  valuable  as  investments  in  software  are  an increasingly important type of intangible capital that is driving innovation (Branstetter, Drev, and Kwon, 2019) and performance (Krishnan et al., 2000).\n\nThird, our results help highlight for firms and managers the importance of OSS to their production, and ideally add weight to arguments that users of OSS should not just free ride but also contribute to the creation and maintenance of OSS (e.g., Henkel, 2008; Nagle, 2018). Such contributions are a fraction of the costs that firms would incur if OSS did not exist and the active participation of OSS users in helping maintain the OSS they use is critical to the health and future well-being of the OSS ecosystem (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021; Zhang et al., 2019).\n\nFourth,  and  finally,  our  study  helps  inform  policymakers  who  have  recently  started  to understand  the  growing  importance  of  OSS  to  the  economy  and  taken  actions  to  support  the ecosystem (European Commission, 2020; Executive Order No. 14028, 2021). However, most of these efforts are related to securing the existing OSS ecosystem, which is quite important, but do\n\nnot go as far as supporting the creation of new OSS. Our results help shine light on the importance of OSS to the overall economy and add weight to calls for more societal support of this critical resource. Our results further show that the majority of the value created by OSS is created by a small  number  of  contributors.  Although  it  has  long  been  known  that  a  small  number  of  OSS contributors do most of the work, we add new insights that show this is even more true for the value creation of widely-used OSS projects and that societal support for these individuals is critical to the future success of OSS, and in turn, the economy.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the empirical setting and data. Section 3 discusses the methods including measurement challenges. In section 4, we estimate the value of open source software. Section 5 concludes.\n\nDocument 16: ## 5. Conclusion\n\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith. We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average value and distributed it across industries.\n\nIn this study we estimate the value of widely-used open source software globally with two unique datasets: the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data. We are able to estimate not only the supply side value of existing code (e.g., the cost it would take to rewrite each piece of widely-used OSS once) but also the demand side value for the private economy (e.g., the cost it would take for each company that uses a piece of OSS to rewrite it). While we do not focus on the long tail of OSS, we consider this an additional contribution of our study as focusing on OSS that is widely used allows us to more precisely understand the value created by OSS, rather than only measuring the  replacement  cost  for  all  OSS  (which  would  overestimate  the  true  value  since  many  OSS projects are not used in production code). However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n\nAdjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.  We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves.  Over  95%  percent  of  the  demand-side  value  is  generated  by  only  five  percent  of programmers, and those programmers contribute not only to a few widely used projects but to substantially more projects than the programmers that are engaged at the lower end of the value distribution.\n\nIn aggregate, our results show the substantial value that OSS contributes to the economy despite this value generally showing up as zero via direct measurement since prices equal zero and quantity is difficult to measure using public data alone. Our research lays the groundwork for future studies of not only OSS, but of all IT and its growing impact on the global economy.\n\nDocument 5: ## Abstract\n\nThe  value  of  a  non-pecuniary  (free)  product  is  inherently  difficult  to  assess.  A  pervasive example is open source software (OSS), a global public good that plays a vital role in the economy and is foundational for most technology we use today. However, it is difficult to measure the value of OSS due to its non-pecuniary nature and lack of centralized usage tracking. Therefore, OSS remains largely unaccounted for in economic measures. Although prior studies have estimated the supply-side costs to recreate this software, a lack of data has hampered estimating the much larger demand-side (usage) value created by OSS. Therefore, to understand the complete economic and social value of widely-used OSS, we leverage unique global data from two complementary sources capturing  OSS  usage  by  millions  of  global  firms.  We  first  estimate  the  supply-side  value  by calculating the cost to recreate the most widely used OSS once. We then calculate the demandside value based on a replacement value for each firm that uses the software and would need to build it internally if OSS did not exist. We estimate the supply-side value of widely-used OSS is $4.15 billion, but that the demand-side value is much larger at $8.8 trillion. We find that firms would need to spend 3.5 times more on software than they currently do if OSS did not exist. The top six programming languages in our sample comprise 84% of the demand-side value of OSS. Further, 96% of the demand-side value is created by only 5% of OSS developers.\n\nJEL Classification:\n\nH4; O3; J0\n\nKeywords: Open-source software, global public good\n\nAcknowledgement: The authors are grateful for  financial  and  administrative  support  from  the Linux  Foundation  without  which  the  data  from  the  Census  would  not  have  otherwise  been available.

Empirical Setting and Data\n\nAlthough the concept of free and open software has existed since the 1950's, it became more popular in the 1980's due to the efforts of Richard Stallman and his launch of the GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation (Maracke, 2019). However, it was in the 1990's that OSS took off after Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel, a now widely adopted OSS operating system (Tozzi, 2016). Today, OSS is considered a key building block of the digital economy and is widely used by software developers in everything from phones to cars to refrigerators to cutting-edge AI (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021).\n\nWe use two complementary main data sources to estimate the value of OSS. The first is the Census and is inward facing. It allows us to identify OSS code that goes into products that firms create. The second dataset is BuiltWith and is outward facing, allowing us to identify OSS code  that  consumers  directly  interact  with  through  firm  websites.  Since  the  raw  data  in  both datasets only contains package names, version numbers, and package manager names, and does not  contain  any  source  code  related  information,  we  first  obtain  the  publicly  accessible  code repository for each package which includes package-level information including the lines of code and  the  programming  languages  used.  One  may  worry  about  double-counting  for  the  value calculations as a result of using two separate datasets. However, the overlap of both the Census and  the  BuiltWith  sample  is  very  small:  there  are  only  18  packages  found  in  both  datasets. Moreover, it is unlikely that double counting is a concern as the two datasets capture different dimensions of OSS usage: the Census captures packaged software whose usage is inward-facing while BuiltWith captures usage in websites that are outward-facing. Finally, as a supplementary\n\ndataset, we use GHTorrent, a detailed history of OSS-related activity on GitHub, the most popular OSS hosting platform and a commonly used data source for studies of OSS (e.g., Burton et al, 2017; Conti, Peukert, and Roche, 2023; Fackler, Hofmann, and Laurentsyeva, 2023; Kim, 2020; Tang, Wang, &amp; Tong, 2023). This detailed historical data allows us to go deeper into how the value  of  OSS  is  created  by  better  understanding  the  dispersion  of  the  contributions  across individual OSS developers. We describe the details of all three data sources and their preparation for estimation below.\n\nCensus. The  Census  II  of  Free  and  Open  Source  Software  (here:  Census)  was  jointly undertaken by the Linux Foundation and the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (Nagle et  al.,  2022). 1 The  Census  was  created  via  the  aggregation  of  data  from  three  major  software composition analysis (SCA) firms with thousands of clients across the globe. SCAs are hired to scan the codebase of a client and gather the OSS usage embedded in their proprietary software to ensure they are not violating any OSS license agreements.  Frequently this takes place as part of 2 the due diligence process related to mergers and acquisitions. Unlike other OSS demand measures available from public sources such as package download counts and code changes, the way this data was collected ensures that we observe the precise amount and type of internal OSS usage of the firms. In addition, it allows us to trace the dependencies each package relies on, so that we can observe the indirect OSS usage that is commonly hidden and difficult to obtain.  The result is over 3 2.7 million observations of OSS packages being used within products created by the SCA client firms for the calendar year 2020 (January 1 to December 31, 2020). 4\n\nThe Census project standardized package names based on the naming system of libraries.io -  a  widely  used  site  maintained  by  Tidelift  that  organizes  information  about  more  than  eight million open source packages. The Census focused on the top 2,000 packages based on usage\n\n1 The precise methodologies for the data collection and aggregation are detailed in the Census report by Nagle et al (2022).\n\n2 OSS usage licenses vary a great deal and while some licenses are very open and allow the code to be reused in any manner, including within proprietary code that will be made available for sale at a non-zero price, other licenses restrict reuse to only be allowed if the resultant code is released under the same OSS license (known as copyleft). A detailed discussion of OSS licenses can be found in Lerner and Tirole (2005) and Almeida et al (2017).\n\n3 Indirect OSS usage is captured by dependency analysis and is necessary to accurately measure the full breadth of the OSS a firm relies on. For example, if a firm's proprietary code calls OSS package A, but package A, in turn, calls package B, then only looking at the direct calls would miss that package B was a required building block for the firm's proprietary code.\n\n4 The Census defines an OSS package as 'a unit of software that can be installed and managed by a package manager,' and  defines  a  package  manager  as  'software  that  automates  the  process  of  installing  and  otherwise  managing packages' (Nagle et al, 2022).\n\nreported from the three of the most prominent SCA vendors to identify the most widely used OSS rather  than  the  long-tail  of  the  usage  distribution.  This  led  to  packages  with  less  than  five observations  of  usage  being  dropped.  Since  packages  written  in  the  JavaScript  programming language, and usually hosted on the Node Package Manager (NPM), are generally smaller (fewer lines  of  code)  than  packages  in  other  languages  and  therefore  frequently  have  higher  usage numbers (since developers must include many small packages instead of a few large packages), the Census separately selected the top 1,000 NPM packages and the top 1,000 non-NPM hosted packages.\n\nThis final dataset covers 70% of the total usage of OSS observed in the raw data of the census.   For  each  of  these  2,000  OSS  packages  in  the  Census,  we  identified  the  raw  code 5 maintained on GitHub, the most widely used platform for hosting OSS.  We first attempted to 6 obtain the GitHub repository uniform resource locator (URL) for each package from libraries.io. We were able to match 1,657 packages to repositories via this initial method.  For URLs without 7 a  matching  repository,  we  performed  Google  searches  loosely  following  the  method  in  Singh (2020). More specifically, for each unmatched package, we used the Google API to search for the package name and 'GitHub Repository' and treated the first GitHub repository URL in the results as  its  best  matched  GitHub  URL.   This  resulted  in  an  additional  174  packages  matched  to  a 8 repository. Finally, we manually searched for URLs for the remaining 169 packages to identify the relevant repository. This entire process resulted in matching 1,840 out of the 2,000 Census packages to a code repository with the raw source code for the package. The unmatched packages were determined to have been either removed from GitHub or became proprietary (and thus the original source code was no longer available) and hence, the manual search allowed us to drop\n\n5 The packages that made up the remaining 30% of the full Census data in the long-tail usage distribution were not shared in the final report and therefore cannot be included in our analysis.\n\n6 GitHub  is  a  hosting  and  collaboration  platform  that  contributors  can  use  to  coordinate  the  development  and distribution of OSS projects. Founded in 2008, GitHub has become the largest hub for OSS development in the world. In January 2023, GitHub had more than 370 million repositories and over 100 million developers. In addition to personal users, a wide range of private firms actively use the GitHub platform, including Microsoft (which bought GitHub in 2018), Facebook, Google, and numerous other small and large firms.\n\n7 We attempted to access all repository URLs obtained as a sanity check to ensure they are in working condition. For those we could not access on GitHub, we manually found the correct URLs.\n\n8 As a robustness check, we randomly selected 50 package-repository matches derived from the Google Search method and we checked them by hand. All matches were manually confirmed to be correct providing additional support for the automated matching method.\n\nthese 160 unmatched packages (less than 8% of the Census sample of 2,000) with high confidence from our analysis.\n\nBuiltWith. The BuiltWith data contains scans of all public websites across the globe and identifies the technologies they use. Unlike the inward facing Census data which focus on the usage of OSS, the BuiltWith data scan for the use of both proprietary and OSS in firm websites without explicit differentiation. To separate OSS from proprietary software in BuiltWith, we turn to the subset of all open source web development software in the technology category that includes \"JavaScript and its libraries,\" which generates 778 observations corresponding to the NPM OSS category  in  the  Census  data.  There  are  two  reasons  for  this  sampling  choice.  First,  this  given category is constructed by BuiltWith and we use it as a proxy for OSS to separate it from pecuniary software.  Second,  JavaScript,  one  of  the  core  technologies  for  building  websites,  is  the  most popular programming language by usage on GitHub (GitHub, 2022) and thus enables us to capture the most important OSS from the demand side perspective. The scans include 8.8 million unique websites and 72.8 million corresponding observations of OSS usage from January 1 to November 16, 2020. Further, to ensure that we measure the value of OSS usage generated by the private sector,  we  match  the  adopting  domains  of  the  JavaScript-related  OSS  from  BuiltWith  with company websites recorded in Orbis, Compustat, and PitchBook, three commonly used databases of corporate activity that capture registered businesses across the world. Performing this match ensures that OSS used by non-commercial websites (e.g., an individual person's personal website) is excluded in our analysis. This results in a match-rate of 38.6%, which corresponds to around 3.4 million websites of distinct firms.\n\nFor the BuiltWith data, we cannot employ the first method we use for the Census (using libraries.io to help identify the repository URL) since only the technology names associated with the  packages  were  provided  by  BuiltWith,  and  other  information  (e.g.,  package  and  package manager  names)  is  not  included. 9 Hence,  we  start  by  performing  the  Google  Search  method mentioned above which results in a match of 695 packages to repositories. We then manually searched the Github URLs for 83 of the remaining unmatched packages, resulting in an addition of 46 packages. In total, for the BuiltWith data we were able to identify 741 out of 778 package-\n\n9 Since the package and package manager names are missing, a precise match using libraries.io was not feasible. Technology names are product names intended for customers and can be less technical and precise than the package names for internal development purposes. Thus, using technology names in a libraries.io search could cause significant ambiguity.\n\nrepository matches. As with the Census data, the remaining 37 unmatched packages (less than 5%) are dropped from our analysis because they had been deleted from GitHub.\n\nGHTorrent database. To obtain measures of the dispersion of the OSS value creation, we utilize  the  GHTorrent  database,  which  contains  the  entire  activity  history  on  GitHub  using GitHub's Representational State Transfer (REST) application programming interface (API). We leveraged  its  records  of  GitHub  repositories,  developer-level  commits,  and  developer  public profile information to estimate the contribution of each developer. We narrowed the sample for our developer contribution analysis in two steps. First, we winnowed the GitHub repositories and their  commits  from  GHTorrent  based  on  the  repository  URLs  of  our  joint  Census-BuiltWith sample. 10 Second, we focus on human contributions to OSS by removing approximately eight thousand (12%) GitHub contributors that we considered to be robots. 11 The final sample contains around sixty thousand developers and 2.3 million commits.\n\nTo prepare these three datasets for estimation, we first identified the number of lines of code and the programming languages used for each package using the OSS packages pygount (to count  the  number  of  lines  of  code)  and  linguist  (to  identify  programming  languages). 12 We categorize each distinct language into one of three different buckets moving from more likely human-written to more likely machine-written (see Table A1). Bucket 1 contains programming and markup languages (which are most likely to be human-written), bucket 3 contains data (most likely to be machine-written), and bucket 2 contains anything in between, such as config files and batch processing (which are sometimes human-written and sometimes machine-written, but it is difficult to tell based purely on looking at the code). 13 For our primary estimation we only use bucket 1 while providing robustness checks for buckets 2 and 3 in the Appendix, and thus our results represent a lower bound. Finally, for some analyses we dig deeper and show the top 5 programming languages (as classified by GitHub, 2022 for the year 2020; the year our data is from). The top 5 programming languages contain C (including C# and C++), Java, JavaScript,\n\n10 The match rate is over 96%, with the unmatched repositories accounting for only 0.15% of our calculated OSS demand value discussed below.\n\n11 The filtering is based on the 'fake user' classification by GHTorrent, as well as any usernames containing words 'bot' or 'robot', surrounded by special characters. This method is more conservative than other methods of bot detection  like  that  used  in  the  GitHub  Innovation  Graph  (https:\/\/innovationgraph.github.com\/),  which  rely  on  a monthly commit frequency threshold.\n\n12 https:\/\/pypi.org\/project\/pygount\/ and https:\/\/github.com\/github-linguist\/linguist\n\n13 Note that our focus is the cost to recreate OSS code written by humans, not robots.

A  pervasive example is open source software (OSS), a global public good that plays a vital role in the economy and is foundational for most technology we use today. However, it is difficult to measure the value of OSS due to its non-pecuniary nature and lack of centralized usage tracking. Therefore, OSS remains largely unaccounted for in economic measures. Although prior studies have estimated the supply-side costs to recreate this software, a lack of data has hampered estimating the much larger demand-side (usage) value created by OSS. Therefore, to understand the complete economic and social value of widely-used OSS, we leverage unique global data from two complementary sources capturing  OSS  usage  by  millions  of  global  firms.  We  first  estimate  the  supply-side  value  by calculating the cost to recreate the most widely used OSS once. We then calculate the demandside value based on a replacement value for each firm that uses the software and would need to build it internally if OSS did not exist. We estimate the supply-side value of widely-used OSS is $4.15 billion, but that the demand-side value is much larger at $8.8 trillion. We find that firms would need to spend 3.5 times more on software than they currently do if OSS did not exist. The top six programming languages in our sample comprise 84% of the demand-side value of OSS. Further, 96% of the demand-side value is created by only 5% of OSS developers.\n\nJEL Classification:\n\nH4; O3; J0\n\nKeywords: Open-source software, global public good\n\nAcknowledgement: The authors are grateful for  financial  and  administrative  support  from  the Linux  Foundation  without  which  the  data  from  the  Census  would  not  have  otherwise  been available.

Introduction\n\nIn 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that 'software is eating the world' (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that 'open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,' (Jacks, 2022). Other recent studies have come to similar conclusions showing that open source software  (OSS)  -  software  whose  source  code  is  publicly  available  for  inspection,  use,  and modification and is often created in a decentralized manner and distributed for free - appears in 96% of codebases (Synopsys 2023), and that some commercial software consists of up to 99.9% freely available OSS (Musseau et al., 2022). Although in its early days OSS frequently copied features from existing proprietary software, OSS today includes cutting edge technology in various fields including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, big data, and analytics.  However, despite the increasing importance of OSS to all software (and therefore to the entire economy), measuring its impact has been elusive. Traditionally, to measure the value created by a good or service,  economists  multiply  the  price  ( p )  times  the  quantity  sold  ( q ).  However,  in  OSS, p is generally zero since the source code is publicly available, and q is  unknown due to the limited number of restrictions around how the code may be copied and reused. For example, if a company downloads  a  piece  of  OSS  from  a  public  code  repository,  it  may  copy  it  thousands  of  times internally (legally) and then share it with suppliers or customers (also legally), so public download data is insufficient. Although some recent studies have sought to estimate the value of p (discussed below), data for estimating q has been unavailable or intractable for anything more than just a handful of OSS packages. Using newly collected data from multiple sources, the goal of this paper is to provide estimates for both p and q and to use those to shine light on the question: What is the value of open source software?\n\nUnderstanding the value of OSS is of critical importance not only due to the role it plays in the economy, but also due to it being one of the most successful and impactful modern examples of the centuries old economic concept of 'the commons' which run the risk of meeting the fate known as 'the tragedy of the commons.' This concept can trace its roots as far back as the 4 th -century BC philosopher Aristotle who wrote 'That which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care. Men pay most attention to what is their own and care less for what is common.'  (Aristotle,  1981).  William  Forster  Lloyd  (1833)  resurfaced  the  idea  in  modern economic thought by highlighting the example of shared tracts of land used for cattle grazing by\n\nmultiple cattle herders who each had an incentive to overuse the shared resource. Garrett Hardin (1968)  brought  the  concept  into  the  broader  zeitgeist  when  he  wrote  an  article  discussing  the problem entitled 'The Tragedy of the Commons.' Building on this work, Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for her research highlighting paths to avoiding the tragedy of the commons through community coordination efforts that did not necessitate government enforced laws to manage and guard the commons (Ostrom 1990). The parallels between shared grazing lands and shared digital infrastructure are palpable - the availability of communal grass to feed cattle, and in turn feed people, was critical to the agrarian economy, and the ability to not have to recreate code that someone else has already written is critical to the modern economy. Further, in both contexts, despite knowing grass and code are critical inputs to the economy, measuring their actual value is difficult. And, as the renowned mathematician and physicist Lord Kelvin is believed to have said, 'If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.' And if you cannot improve and maintain it, such common goods may crumble under the weight of their own success as they are overused, but underinvested in (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021). Therefore, measuring the value OSS creates is crucial to the future health of the digital economy, and the rest of the economy that is built on top of it.\n\nImportantly, recent studies have attempted to address these measurement issues but fall short of capturing both the breadth and depth of OSS usage - a gap we seek to fill with this paper. For example, researchers have attempted to gain breadth by using novel methodologies to estimate the labor replacement value of the current corpus of OSS created in the United States at $38 billion in 2019 (Robbins et al., 2021) and that created in the European Union at €1 billion (Blind et al., 2021) by imputing the labor costs that it would have taken to rewrite existing OSS. Such efforts do a very good job at estimating what it would cost to replace all existing OSS if it disappeared tomorrow. However, the resultant estimates rely on two important assumptions. First, that all OSS is equally valuable from a usage standpoint, and second that the concept of OSS would still exist, and society would just need to rewrite the code once, thus addressing the aforementioned problem of a missing value for p , but not addressing the missing value of q . In a world where OSS did not exist at all, then each piece of OSS software would not need to be rewritten just once, but instead would need to be rewritten by every firm that used the software (assuming the firm could freely share the software within its boundaries). Other research (Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; MurcianoGoroff, Zhuo, and Greenstein, 2021) has gone deeper into this hypothetical, albeit in a narrow\n\nmanner, by only focusing on web servers (which are public facing on the Internet and can therefore be readily measured). Using different methods, both studies measure q for this one type of software and impute p by using a goods replacement value approach based on the prices for closed-source alternatives offered by firms. With data from the United States the resulting estimates show a value of  $2  billion  for  the  OSS  Apache  Web  Server  in  2012  (Greenstein  and  Nagle,  2014)  and  a combined value of $4.5 billion for Apache and the increasingly popular OSS web server nginx in 2018 (Murciano-Goroff, et al., 2021). However, although web servers are an important part of the OSS  ecosystem,  they  constitute  a  small  portion  of  it.  We  seek  to  build  upon  the  important contributions this existing research has made in an attempt to go both broad and deep to create a more complete measure of the value of OSS.\n\nTo consider the value of OSS in both a broad and deep manner, we use data from two primary sources that allow us to gain insights into the OSS used at tens of thousands of firms across the world. The first is the 'Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries' (Nagle et al., 2022). The Census II project utilized partnerships with multiple software composition analysis (SCA) firms to create various lists of the most widely used OSS. SCAs are hired to scan the codebases of a company to ensure they are not violating any OSS licenses and, as a byproduct, track all the OSS code used by their customers and the products they build. The Census II project aggregated data from multiple SCAs to build a dataset of OSS usage at tens of thousands of firms based  on  millions  of  data  points  (observations  of  OSS  usage).  The  second  data  source  is  the BuiltWith dataset, from which we leverage scans of nearly nine million websites to identify the underlying technology deployed by these websites, including OSS libraries. The BuiltWith data has been used in multiple academic studies (DeStefano &amp; Timmis 2023, Dushnitsky &amp; Stroube 2021, Koning et al.. 2022), but to our knowledge this is the first one to focus on OSS usage. The Census II data and the BuiltWith data are complementary as the former focuses on OSS that is built  into  the  software  a  company  sells,  while  the  latter  focuses  on  OSS  that  is  built  into  a company's website, thus reducing the chances of double-counting observations across the datasets. In aggregate, these two datasets combined create the most complete measurement of OSS usage ( q ) to date. Further, by focusing on OSS that is widely deployed and used by firms, rather than considering all the projects that exist in an OSS repository, we enhance the methodologies of prior studies by reducing the likelihood of measurement error stemming from projects that are posted as publicly available OSS but are not actually used in any practical manner. Not accounting for this\n\nmeasurement error would lead to overestimation of the actual value of OSS as projects that are widely used would be valued in the same way as projects that are not used at all.\n\nTo estimate p ,  we  follow  the  literature  discussed  above  and  use  the  labor  replacement value. First, we calculate the labor cost it would take an individual firm to recreate a given OSS package by measuring the number of lines of code within the package and then applying the Constructive Cost Model II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) - also known as COCOMO II to estimate the number of person-hours it would take to write the code from scratch. We then utilize global wage data from Salary Expert to get an accurate estimate of the labor costs a firm would incur if this piece of OSS did not exist. These costs can be combined with the q values from above at the OSS package level to estimate the combined value of all OSS from both the supply and demand sides.\n\nWe find a value ranging from $1.22 billion to $6.22 billion if we were to decide as a society to recreate all widely used OSS on the supply side. However, considering the actual usage of OSS leads to a demand-side value that is orders of magnitude larger and ranges from $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion, if each firm who used an OSS package had to recreate it from scratch (e.g., the concept of OSS did not exist). We document substantial heterogeneity of the value of OSS by programming  language  and  internal  vs  outward-facing  programming  efforts.  Further,  we  find considerable  heterogeneity  in  value  contributions  by  programmers  as  5%  of  programmers  are responsible for more than 90% of the value created on the supply- and demand- side. The data we use is arguably the most comprehensive source of data to measure the value created by firm usage of OSS at this time. However, as for any project, the evidence is not complete and we argue that we underestimate the value since our data, e.g., does not include operating systems, which are a substantial omitted category of OSS.\n\nThis study makes four important contributions to the academic literature, practitioners, and policy makers. First, it provides the most complete estimate of the value of widely used OSS to date  by  accounting  for  not  only  the  supply-side  of  OSS  (price  to  create  it),  but  also  for  the usage\/demand-side at a scale that has not been done before. While prior estimates of the value of OSS only went either broad (estimating the supply-side costs of a large swath of OSS) or deep (estimating the value created by one particular type of OSS), this study does both by using unique datasets that allow for a better understanding of the breadth and depth of OSS usage. Further, rather than measuring the value of all OSS, this study focuses on the value of OSS that is used by firms\n\nto create its products and websites, limiting the measurement error occurring in studies that are unable to account for which OSS is actually used in production. This contribution builds upon, and extends, important research (e.g., Blind et al., 2021; Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021; Robbins et al., 2021) that has sought to identify the value of this vital resource that contributes a great deal to the modern economy despite the difficulties measuring this contribution. In  doing  so,  it  adds  insights  to  a  long-running  discussion  related  to  the  impact  of  information technology (IT) on productivity (Brynjolfsson, 1993; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 1996; Nagle, 2019a; Solow, 1987) known as the 'productivity paradox' where IT investments can have limited impact on productivity statistics. This debate has continued into the emerging context of AI (Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson, 2018). Our work contributes to this conversation by highlighting a massive societal level cost-savings (and hence productivity enhancement) that is created by the existence of OSS.\n\nSecond, our research contributes methodological advances to the study of intangible capital by highlighting novel sources of data related to investments in OSS. Prior research has shown that intangible capital plays an increasingly important role in economic growth (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel,  2009)  and  firm  value  (Peters  and  Taylor,  2017),  but  it  often  goes  unmeasured  or misattributed (Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou, 2014). Further, we demonstrate how these data sources can be used to understand the true investments in software that a firm makes, and that which they would have to make if OSS did not exist.  This  is  valuable  as  investments  in  software  are  an increasingly important type of intangible capital that is driving innovation (Branstetter, Drev, and Kwon, 2019) and performance (Krishnan et al., 2000).\n\nThird, our results help highlight for firms and managers the importance of OSS to their production, and ideally add weight to arguments that users of OSS should not just free ride but also contribute to the creation and maintenance of OSS (e.g., Henkel, 2008; Nagle, 2018). Such contributions are a fraction of the costs that firms would incur if OSS did not exist and the active participation of OSS users in helping maintain the OSS they use is critical to the health and future well-being of the OSS ecosystem (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021; Zhang et al., 2019).\n\nFourth,  and  finally,  our  study  helps  inform  policymakers  who  have  recently  started  to understand  the  growing  importance  of  OSS  to  the  economy  and  taken  actions  to  support  the ecosystem (European Commission, 2020; Executive Order No. 14028, 2021). However, most of these efforts are related to securing the existing OSS ecosystem, which is quite important, but do\n\nnot go as far as supporting the creation of new OSS. Our results help shine light on the importance of OSS to the overall economy and add weight to calls for more societal support of this critical resource. Our results further show that the majority of the value created by OSS is created by a small  number  of  contributors.  Although  it  has  long  been  known  that  a  small  number  of  OSS contributors do most of the work, we add new insights that show this is even more true for the value creation of widely-used OSS projects and that societal support for these individuals is critical to the future success of OSS, and in turn, the economy.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the empirical setting and data. Section 3 discusses the methods including measurement challenges. In section 4, we estimate the value of open source software. Section 5 concludes.\n\nDocument 16: ## 5. Conclusion\n\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith. We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average value and distributed it across industries.\n\nIn this study we estimate the value of widely-used open source software globally with two unique datasets: the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data. We are able to estimate not only the supply side value of existing code (e.g., the cost it would take to rewrite each piece of widely-used OSS once) but also the demand side value for the private economy (e.g., the cost it would take for each company that uses a piece of OSS to rewrite it). While we do not focus on the long tail of OSS, we consider this an additional contribution of our study as focusing on OSS that is widely used allows us to more precisely understand the value created by OSS, rather than only measuring the  replacement  cost  for  all  OSS  (which  would  overestimate  the  true  value  since  many  OSS projects are not used in production code). However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n\nAdjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.  We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves.  Over  95%  percent  of  the  demand-side  value  is  generated  by  only  five  percent  of programmers, and those programmers contribute not only to a few widely used projects but to substantially more projects than the programmers that are engaged at the lower end of the value distribution.\n\nIn aggregate, our results show the substantial value that OSS contributes to the economy despite this value generally showing up as zero via direct measurement since prices equal zero and quantity is difficult to measure using public data alone. Our research lays the groundwork for future studies of not only OSS, but of all IT and its growing impact on the global economy.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"complex","seed_document_id":5,"topic":"Others"}}

We obtain a similar pattern that has been established already in the aggregate when pooling both data sources (Figure 1) albeit the impact of JavaScript is substantially lower.  On  the  supply  side  of  the  Census  in  Panel  A,  Java  has  the  second-highest  value  while JavaScript  code  from  the  Census  contributes  to  a  substantially  lower  value  to  the  aggregate. Similarly, the supply side values of C, Python, and Typescript are mainly driven by the Census. From the demand side Panel B we find that Go is the most popular language for inward facing code while all other languages appear to be negligible in relative terms.\n\nFigure 2, Panel C and Panel D show the supply and demand side values for the BuiltWith dataset. The supply side value in Panel C clearly indicates that the value from the BuiltWith sample is driven by JavaScript code, which is a good sanity check since we focused on JavaScript packages to proxy for OSS in the BuiltWith sample, as discussed above. The second highest value is created by TypeScript which is reassuring since it is a superset of JavaScript. Panel D shows a similar pattern  on  the  usage  side  where  most  of  the  value  arises  from  JavaScript  while  TypeScript  is trailing at the second spot as well. The other languages contribute only marginal amounts to the supply and demand side values. Overall, these findings are broadly consistent with the main use cases of the various languages (web programming vs. application programming) and an idea that languages through which value are generated are not necessarily identical to languages that are used by the general public.\n\n--- Figure 3 about here ---\n\nFigure 3 shows the demand-side value of OSS across industries by NAICS 2-digit codes using the BuiltWith online data. 20 This can be interpreted as the value each of these industries receive because OSS exists. The industry with the highest usage value of around $43 billion is 'Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.' 'Retail Trade' as well as 'Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services' make up another large part of the demand-side externally facing value of OSS with $36 billion and $35 billion, respectively. In contrast, industries that constitute just a small portion of the value are 'Mining, Quarrying, and Oil  and  Gas  Extraction',  'Utilities',  'Agriculture,  Forestry,  Fishing,  and  Hunting.'  The  latter industries are classical non-service sector industries and as such software is expected to play less of a role there.\n\nDocument 13: ## --- Figure 1 about here ---\n\nFigure 1 shows the heterogeneity of the value of OSS across the top programming languages. Panel A shows the supply side value with the labor value being displayed on the vertical axis. We find that OSS packages created in Go have the highest value with $803 million in value that would have to be created from scratch if the OSS packages did not exist. Go is closely followed by JavaScript  and  Java  with  $758  million  and  $658  million,  respectively.  The  value  of  C  and Typescript is $406 million and $317 million, respectively, while Python has the lowest value of the top languages with around $55 million. JavaScript is not only the top language on GitHub since at least 2014 (GitHub, 2022) it is also the language with one of the highest values in our data. In contrast, Python became more popular over time moving up from the number four spot to the number two language being used in 2020 across all OSS packages on GitHub, while it is in the last spot of our top languages.\n\nPanel B shows the demand side value across the top programming languages. Based on usage generated value, Go is more than four times the value of the next language, JavaScript.\n\nTypescript (a language that extends JavaScript) has seen immense growth rising from the tenth spot of the top 10 languages in 2017 to the fourth spot in 2020 which is also reflected in our data with  Typescript  being  the  third  most  important  language  on  the  demand  side.  The  two  web languages are followed by C and far behind are Java, and Python.\n\nDocument 16: ## 5. Conclusion\n\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith. We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average value and distributed it across industries.\n\nIn this study we estimate the value of widely-used open source software globally with two unique datasets: the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data. We are able to estimate not only the supply side value of existing code (e.g., the cost it would take to rewrite each piece of widely-used OSS once) but also the demand side value for the private economy (e.g., the cost it would take for each company that uses a piece of OSS to rewrite it). While we do not focus on the long tail of OSS, we consider this an additional contribution of our study as focusing on OSS that is widely used allows us to more precisely understand the value created by OSS, rather than only measuring the  replacement  cost  for  all  OSS  (which  would  overestimate  the  true  value  since  many  OSS projects are not used in production code). However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n\nAdjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.  We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves.  Over  95%  percent  of  the  demand-side  value  is  generated  by  only  five  percent  of programmers, and those programmers contribute not only to a few widely used projects but to substantially more projects than the programmers that are engaged at the lower end of the value distribution.\n\nIn aggregate, our results show the substantial value that OSS contributes to the economy despite this value generally showing up as zero via direct measurement since prices equal zero and quantity is difficult to measure using public data alone. Our research lays the groundwork for future studies of not only OSS, but of all IT and its growing impact on the global economy.\n\nDocument 12: ## --- Table 1 about here ---\n\nTable  1  shows  descriptive  statistics  from  both  data  sets  separately.  The  inward-facing Census  (Panel  A)  contains  just  over  261.7  million  lines  of  code  with  72%  of  the  lines  being attributable to the top programming languages. The average package includes 142 thousand lines of code with a slightly lower average of 113 thousand lines of code for the subset of top languages. When considering the demand (usage) side, we observe that the Census packages were used over 2.7 million times while 92% of this usage is attributable to the top languages. The average package was used 1,472.4 times with a higher usage of around 1,497.5 for the top  languages.  For  the outward-facing  BuiltWith  data  we  find  similar  patterns,  but  at  different  levels.  The  packages included from BuiltWith include over 82 million lines of code, 71% of which are attributable to the  top  programming  languages.  The  average  package  within  the  BuiltWith  sample  has  111 thousand  lines  of  code  with  a  lower  average  of  around  80  thousand  lines  of  code  for  the  top languages. This is because our BuiltWith data primarily consists of JavaScript-based packages, which are often smaller than packages written in other languages. BuiltWith packages were used over 142 thousand times where 99.97% were attributable to the top languages. Next, we used these raw observations to calculate the value of all OSS through the labor market approach and estimated the value created from the supply and demand side.\n\n--- Table 2 about here ---\n\nTable 2 shows the estimates for the value of OSS based on the firm-relevant joint Census and BuiltWith sample. All estimates in Table 2 are based only on software languages classified in bucket  1  from  Table  A1,  which  are  the  most  likely  to  be  written  by  a  human  rather  than  a machine. 19 The first column contains estimates with wages from a low income country (India), the global  average  wage,  and  a  high  income  country  (United  States  of  America),  respectively  (as described above). To reproduce all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the idea of OSS still exists, but all current OSS is deleted and needs to be coded from scratch), using programmers at the average developer wage from India, it would require an investment of $1.22 billion. In contrast, if we use the average developer wage from the United States, then reproducing all widely-used OSS would require  an  investment  of  $6.22  billion.  Using  a  pool  of  programmers  from  across  the  world, weighed based on the existing geographic contributions to OSS as discussed above, would lead to an investment somewhere in between the low and high-income country, $4.15 billion. It is useful to compare these numbers to those from similar studies to understand differences in valuing all OSS (prior studies) versus that which is widely used (our study). Robbins et al. (2021) and Blind et al. (2021) use a method similar to ours and estimate that the value of OSS created in the US is $38 billion in 2019 and that created in the EU is €1 billion in 2018. Wachs et al. (2022) show that roughly 50% of OSS contributions come from the US and EU combined. In aggregate, that would lead these studies to give a global value of OSS of $78 billion. Thus, our middle estimate of a supply-side value of $4.15 billion for only firm-oriented and widely used OSS is a credible lowerbound and highlights the higher estimations of the total of supply-side value of OSS when not considering whether or not a given OSS package is widely used. This further indicates that the supply-side value of the most widely used OSS is roughly 5.5% of the supply-side value of all OSS.\n\nThe second column in Table 2 contains the demand side estimates based on the labor market approach. We find that if firms had to recreate all OSS packages they used (e.g., OSS itself no longer existed and every firm that used an OSS package had to recreate it), then the entire cost would amount to between $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion using labor from the low wage or high wage country only, respectively. A pool of programmers across the globe could recreate all of OSS that is being widely used for a cost of approximately $8.80 trillion. Interpreting this number is\n\n19 Tables in the appendix show the equivalent values from Table 2 when including software language buckets 1 and 2 (Table A3) and all three software language buckets (Table A4).\n\nslightly more complicated but still feasible. According to a Statista (2023) report, global software revenue in 2020 (the same year as our data) was $531.7 billion. However, this represents a flow, not a stock, of software. Relying on government estimates that software fully depreciates over three years, we can do a back of the envelope calculation and consider the purchase value of the full stock of prepackaged software used in 2020 as the aggregate of that sold from 2018 to 2020, which is $1.54 trillion. Further, this represents only the expenditure on prepackaged software and does  not  include  custom  purchased  or  in-house  developed  software.  Here,  the  best  obtainable estimates of private-sector investment in software overall come from the United States National Income and Product Accounts data (NIPA 2023). In 2020, the national account data shows that in the  US,  private  firms  spent  $479.2  billion  on  software,  of  which  45%  ($215.5  billion)  was prepackaged. If we assume this is a consistent ratio for the rest of the world, then the total amount firms spent on software being used in 2020 was $3.4 trillion (= $1.54 trillion\/0.45). Combining this rough estimate with the demand side estimate of the value of OSS based on an average global wage ($8.8 trillion), this indicates firms would spend $12.2 trillion (=$3.4 trillion + $8.8 trillion), or three and a half times what they currently spend if they needed to pay in-house developers to write the OSS that they currently use for free.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"complex","seed_document_id":14,"topic":"Others"}}

Introduction\n\nIn 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that 'software is eating the world' (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that 'open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,' (Jacks, 2022). Other recent studies have come to similar conclusions showing that open source software  (OSS)  -  software  whose  source  code  is  publicly  available  for  inspection,  use,  and modification and is often created in a decentralized manner and distributed for free - appears in 96% of codebases (Synopsys 2023), and that some commercial software consists of up to 99.9% freely available OSS (Musseau et al., 2022). Although in its early days OSS frequently copied features from existing proprietary software, OSS today includes cutting edge technology in various fields including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, big data, and analytics.  However, despite the increasing importance of OSS to all software (and therefore to the entire economy), measuring its impact has been elusive. Traditionally, to measure the value created by a good or service,  economists  multiply  the  price  ( p )  times  the  quantity  sold  ( q ).  However,  in  OSS, p is generally zero since the source code is publicly available, and q is  unknown due to the limited number of restrictions around how the code may be copied and reused. For example, if a company downloads  a  piece  of  OSS  from  a  public  code  repository,  it  may  copy  it  thousands  of  times internally (legally) and then share it with suppliers or customers (also legally), so public download data is insufficient. Although some recent studies have sought to estimate the value of p (discussed below), data for estimating q has been unavailable or intractable for anything more than just a handful of OSS packages. Using newly collected data from multiple sources, the goal of this paper is to provide estimates for both p and q and to use those to shine light on the question: What is the value of open source software?\n\nUnderstanding the value of OSS is of critical importance not only due to the role it plays in the economy, but also due to it being one of the most successful and impactful modern examples of the centuries old economic concept of 'the commons' which run the risk of meeting the fate known as 'the tragedy of the commons.' This concept can trace its roots as far back as the 4 th -century BC philosopher Aristotle who wrote 'That which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care. Men pay most attention to what is their own and care less for what is common.'  (Aristotle,  1981).  William  Forster  Lloyd  (1833)  resurfaced  the  idea  in  modern economic thought by highlighting the example of shared tracts of land used for cattle grazing by\n\nmultiple cattle herders who each had an incentive to overuse the shared resource. Garrett Hardin (1968)  brought  the  concept  into  the  broader  zeitgeist  when  he  wrote  an  article  discussing  the problem entitled 'The Tragedy of the Commons.' Building on this work, Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for her research highlighting paths to avoiding the tragedy of the commons through community coordination efforts that did not necessitate government enforced laws to manage and guard the commons (Ostrom 1990). The parallels between shared grazing lands and shared digital infrastructure are palpable - the availability of communal grass to feed cattle, and in turn feed people, was critical to the agrarian economy, and the ability to not have to recreate code that someone else has already written is critical to the modern economy. Further, in both contexts, despite knowing grass and code are critical inputs to the economy, measuring their actual value is difficult. And, as the renowned mathematician and physicist Lord Kelvin is believed to have said, 'If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.' And if you cannot improve and maintain it, such common goods may crumble under the weight of their own success as they are overused, but underinvested in (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021). Therefore, measuring the value OSS creates is crucial to the future health of the digital economy, and the rest of the economy that is built on top of it.\n\nImportantly, recent studies have attempted to address these measurement issues but fall short of capturing both the breadth and depth of OSS usage - a gap we seek to fill with this paper. For example, researchers have attempted to gain breadth by using novel methodologies to estimate the labor replacement value of the current corpus of OSS created in the United States at $38 billion in 2019 (Robbins et al., 2021) and that created in the European Union at €1 billion (Blind et al., 2021) by imputing the labor costs that it would have taken to rewrite existing OSS. Such efforts do a very good job at estimating what it would cost to replace all existing OSS if it disappeared tomorrow. However, the resultant estimates rely on two important assumptions. First, that all OSS is equally valuable from a usage standpoint, and second that the concept of OSS would still exist, and society would just need to rewrite the code once, thus addressing the aforementioned problem of a missing value for p , but not addressing the missing value of q . In a world where OSS did not exist at all, then each piece of OSS software would not need to be rewritten just once, but instead would need to be rewritten by every firm that used the software (assuming the firm could freely share the software within its boundaries). Other research (Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; MurcianoGoroff, Zhuo, and Greenstein, 2021) has gone deeper into this hypothetical, albeit in a narrow\n\nmanner, by only focusing on web servers (which are public facing on the Internet and can therefore be readily measured). Using different methods, both studies measure q for this one type of software and impute p by using a goods replacement value approach based on the prices for closed-source alternatives offered by firms. With data from the United States the resulting estimates show a value of  $2  billion  for  the  OSS  Apache  Web  Server  in  2012  (Greenstein  and  Nagle,  2014)  and  a combined value of $4.5 billion for Apache and the increasingly popular OSS web server nginx in 2018 (Murciano-Goroff, et al., 2021). However, although web servers are an important part of the OSS  ecosystem,  they  constitute  a  small  portion  of  it.  We  seek  to  build  upon  the  important contributions this existing research has made in an attempt to go both broad and deep to create a more complete measure of the value of OSS.\n\nTo consider the value of OSS in both a broad and deep manner, we use data from two primary sources that allow us to gain insights into the OSS used at tens of thousands of firms across the world. The first is the 'Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries' (Nagle et al., 2022). The Census II project utilized partnerships with multiple software composition analysis (SCA) firms to create various lists of the most widely used OSS. SCAs are hired to scan the codebases of a company to ensure they are not violating any OSS licenses and, as a byproduct, track all the OSS code used by their customers and the products they build. The Census II project aggregated data from multiple SCAs to build a dataset of OSS usage at tens of thousands of firms based  on  millions  of  data  points  (observations  of  OSS  usage).  The  second  data  source  is  the BuiltWith dataset, from which we leverage scans of nearly nine million websites to identify the underlying technology deployed by these websites, including OSS libraries. The BuiltWith data has been used in multiple academic studies (DeStefano &amp; Timmis 2023, Dushnitsky &amp; Stroube 2021, Koning et al.. 2022), but to our knowledge this is the first one to focus on OSS usage. The Census II data and the BuiltWith data are complementary as the former focuses on OSS that is built  into  the  software  a  company  sells,  while  the  latter  focuses  on  OSS  that  is  built  into  a company's website, thus reducing the chances of double-counting observations across the datasets. In aggregate, these two datasets combined create the most complete measurement of OSS usage ( q ) to date. Further, by focusing on OSS that is widely deployed and used by firms, rather than considering all the projects that exist in an OSS repository, we enhance the methodologies of prior studies by reducing the likelihood of measurement error stemming from projects that are posted as publicly available OSS but are not actually used in any practical manner. Not accounting for this\n\nmeasurement error would lead to overestimation of the actual value of OSS as projects that are widely used would be valued in the same way as projects that are not used at all.\n\nTo estimate p ,  we  follow  the  literature  discussed  above  and  use  the  labor  replacement value. First, we calculate the labor cost it would take an individual firm to recreate a given OSS package by measuring the number of lines of code within the package and then applying the Constructive Cost Model II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) - also known as COCOMO II to estimate the number of person-hours it would take to write the code from scratch. We then utilize global wage data from Salary Expert to get an accurate estimate of the labor costs a firm would incur if this piece of OSS did not exist. These costs can be combined with the q values from above at the OSS package level to estimate the combined value of all OSS from both the supply and demand sides.\n\nWe find a value ranging from $1.22 billion to $6.22 billion if we were to decide as a society to recreate all widely used OSS on the supply side. However, considering the actual usage of OSS leads to a demand-side value that is orders of magnitude larger and ranges from $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion, if each firm who used an OSS package had to recreate it from scratch (e.g., the concept of OSS did not exist). We document substantial heterogeneity of the value of OSS by programming  language  and  internal  vs  outward-facing  programming  efforts.  Further,  we  find considerable  heterogeneity  in  value  contributions  by  programmers  as  5%  of  programmers  are responsible for more than 90% of the value created on the supply- and demand- side. The data we use is arguably the most comprehensive source of data to measure the value created by firm usage of OSS at this time. However, as for any project, the evidence is not complete and we argue that we underestimate the value since our data, e.g., does not include operating systems, which are a substantial omitted category of OSS.\n\nThis study makes four important contributions to the academic literature, practitioners, and policy makers. First, it provides the most complete estimate of the value of widely used OSS to date  by  accounting  for  not  only  the  supply-side  of  OSS  (price  to  create  it),  but  also  for  the usage\/demand-side at a scale that has not been done before. While prior estimates of the value of OSS only went either broad (estimating the supply-side costs of a large swath of OSS) or deep (estimating the value created by one particular type of OSS), this study does both by using unique datasets that allow for a better understanding of the breadth and depth of OSS usage. Further, rather than measuring the value of all OSS, this study focuses on the value of OSS that is used by firms\n\nto create its products and websites, limiting the measurement error occurring in studies that are unable to account for which OSS is actually used in production. This contribution builds upon, and extends, important research (e.g., Blind et al., 2021; Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021; Robbins et al., 2021) that has sought to identify the value of this vital resource that contributes a great deal to the modern economy despite the difficulties measuring this contribution. In  doing  so,  it  adds  insights  to  a  long-running  discussion  related  to  the  impact  of  information technology (IT) on productivity (Brynjolfsson, 1993; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 1996; Nagle, 2019a; Solow, 1987) known as the 'productivity paradox' where IT investments can have limited impact on productivity statistics. This debate has continued into the emerging context of AI (Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson, 2018). Our work contributes to this conversation by highlighting a massive societal level cost-savings (and hence productivity enhancement) that is created by the existence of OSS.\n\nSecond, our research contributes methodological advances to the study of intangible capital by highlighting novel sources of data related to investments in OSS. Prior research has shown that intangible capital plays an increasingly important role in economic growth (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel,  2009)  and  firm  value  (Peters  and  Taylor,  2017),  but  it  often  goes  unmeasured  or misattributed (Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou, 2014). Further, we demonstrate how these data sources can be used to understand the true investments in software that a firm makes, and that which they would have to make if OSS did not exist.  This  is  valuable  as  investments  in  software  are  an increasingly important type of intangible capital that is driving innovation (Branstetter, Drev, and Kwon, 2019) and performance (Krishnan et al., 2000).\n\nThird, our results help highlight for firms and managers the importance of OSS to their production, and ideally add weight to arguments that users of OSS should not just free ride but also contribute to the creation and maintenance of OSS (e.g., Henkel, 2008; Nagle, 2018). Such contributions are a fraction of the costs that firms would incur if OSS did not exist and the active participation of OSS users in helping maintain the OSS they use is critical to the health and future well-being of the OSS ecosystem (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021; Zhang et al., 2019).\n\nFourth,  and  finally,  our  study  helps  inform  policymakers  who  have  recently  started  to understand  the  growing  importance  of  OSS  to  the  economy  and  taken  actions  to  support  the ecosystem (European Commission, 2020; Executive Order No. 14028, 2021). However, most of these efforts are related to securing the existing OSS ecosystem, which is quite important, but do\n\nnot go as far as supporting the creation of new OSS. Our results help shine light on the importance of OSS to the overall economy and add weight to calls for more societal support of this critical resource. Our results further show that the majority of the value created by OSS is created by a small  number  of  contributors.  Although  it  has  long  been  known  that  a  small  number  of  OSS contributors do most of the work, we add new insights that show this is even more true for the value creation of widely-used OSS projects and that societal support for these individuals is critical to the future success of OSS, and in turn, the economy.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the empirical setting and data. Section 3 discusses the methods including measurement challenges. In section 4, we estimate the value of open source software.

In the first step, we measure the value contributions by developers. In a second step, we obtain a measure for the number of repositories developers contribute to. Finally, we provide a graphical representation of both using the commonly known concept of the Lorenz curve to better understand the extent of inequality in contributions. We describe the details below.\n\nValue Contribution. We calculated the supply and demand values of OSS that each developer contributed. At the repository level, we quantified each developer's proportional work contribution by calculating their share of commits to the total number of commits for a repository. This share was subsequently multiplied with the repository's demand and supply values separately to derive\n\n17 There are 179 counties in Wachs et al. (2022), but the top 30 countries consist of over 88% of the global active contributors with each of the rest having less than 0.6% share. The top 30 countries are listed in Table A2.\n\n18 We choose the high- and low-wage reference countries based on a combination of the number of active GitHub developers and the average annual software developer base wage.\n\nthe value-added contribution of that individual contributor to the repository. Finally, we aggregate the value contributions across all repositories for each developer. The individual value contribution from a unique developer Dev , 𝑉 -+.\/ , can be expressed as:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere 𝜎 ( +.\/ is the share of commits the focal developer made in repository  , and i 𝑉 (-is the demand or supply value of the entire repository   specified in Equations (1) and (2), with i 𝑗 ∈ {𝐷, 𝑆} , and N is the number of repositories in our main sample, i.e. Census and BuiltWith combined.\n\nRepository  Contribution. This  is  simply  the  number  of  repositories  a  given  developer contributes to, and it is expressed as follows:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere   is the indicator function equal to 1 when the developer has a non-zero number of commits 𝟙 to  repository i .  This  measure  entails  the  variety  of  OSS  needs  being  addressed  by  individual developers. Jointly with the value contribution measure, they help us understand whether the value that is being generated overall is concentrated within a small number of developers. It may be generally more desirable for the whole OSS ecosystem and its diversity if individual developers participate in many repositories and not just a few.\n\nMeasuring  the  Dispersion  of  Contributions . To  graphically  examine  the  dispersion  of developer contribution values, we utilized Lorenz curves (Lorenz, 1905), with respect to both demand and supply side values. Lorenz curves are a well-established way to represent inequality and, as such, they allow us to better understand how dispersed developer contributions to OSS within the private economy are. Developers are systematically arranged in ascending order based on their contributions to OSS demand and supply, as delineated in Equation (7). Subsequently, these ranks were normalized to a scale ranging from 0 to 100 percentiles, serving as the x-axis values for the Lorenz Curves. The y-axis, on the other hand, presents the corresponding value contributions 𝑉 -+.\/ . The graphical representation in the results section will elucidate the degree of inequality pertaining to the value contributions among developers. To supplement the analysis, we\n\nfurther investigated how dispersed the repository contribution, 𝑁 +.\/ , is by plotting Equation (8). This enables us to ascertain whether any substantial value inequality stems from top contributors predominantly focusing on a narrow subset of exceptionally popular repositories, or alternatively, from their engagement with a broader spectrum of successful repositories.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"complex","seed_document_id":10,"topic":"Others"}}

Empirical Setting and Data\n\nAlthough the concept of free and open software has existed since the 1950's, it became more popular in the 1980's due to the efforts of Richard Stallman and his launch of the GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation (Maracke, 2019). However, it was in the 1990's that OSS took off after Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel, a now widely adopted OSS operating system (Tozzi, 2016). Today, OSS is considered a key building block of the digital economy and is widely used by software developers in everything from phones to cars to refrigerators to cutting-edge AI (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021).\n\nWe use two complementary main data sources to estimate the value of OSS. The first is the Census and is inward facing. It allows us to identify OSS code that goes into products that firms create. The second dataset is BuiltWith and is outward facing, allowing us to identify OSS code  that  consumers  directly  interact  with  through  firm  websites.  Since  the  raw  data  in  both datasets only contains package names, version numbers, and package manager names, and does not  contain  any  source  code  related  information,  we  first  obtain  the  publicly  accessible  code repository for each package which includes package-level information including the lines of code and  the  programming  languages  used.  One  may  worry  about  double-counting  for  the  value calculations as a result of using two separate datasets. However, the overlap of both the Census and  the  BuiltWith  sample  is  very  small:  there  are  only  18  packages  found  in  both  datasets. Moreover, it is unlikely that double counting is a concern as the two datasets capture different dimensions of OSS usage: the Census captures packaged software whose usage is inward-facing while BuiltWith captures usage in websites that are outward-facing. Finally, as a supplementary\n\ndataset, we use GHTorrent, a detailed history of OSS-related activity on GitHub, the most popular OSS hosting platform and a commonly used data source for studies of OSS (e.g., Burton et al, 2017; Conti, Peukert, and Roche, 2023; Fackler, Hofmann, and Laurentsyeva, 2023; Kim, 2020; Tang, Wang, &amp; Tong, 2023). This detailed historical data allows us to go deeper into how the value  of  OSS  is  created  by  better  understanding  the  dispersion  of  the  contributions  across individual OSS developers. We describe the details of all three data sources and their preparation for estimation below.\n\nCensus. The  Census  II  of  Free  and  Open  Source  Software  (here:  Census)  was  jointly undertaken by the Linux Foundation and the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (Nagle et  al.,  2022). 1 The  Census  was  created  via  the  aggregation  of  data  from  three  major  software composition analysis (SCA) firms with thousands of clients across the globe. SCAs are hired to scan the codebase of a client and gather the OSS usage embedded in their proprietary software to ensure they are not violating any OSS license agreements.  Frequently this takes place as part of 2 the due diligence process related to mergers and acquisitions. Unlike other OSS demand measures available from public sources such as package download counts and code changes, the way this data was collected ensures that we observe the precise amount and type of internal OSS usage of the firms. In addition, it allows us to trace the dependencies each package relies on, so that we can observe the indirect OSS usage that is commonly hidden and difficult to obtain.  The result is over 3 2.7 million observations of OSS packages being used within products created by the SCA client firms for the calendar year 2020 (January 1 to December 31, 2020). 4\n\nThe Census project standardized package names based on the naming system of libraries.io -  a  widely  used  site  maintained  by  Tidelift  that  organizes  information  about  more  than  eight million open source packages. The Census focused on the top 2,000 packages based on usage\n\n1 The precise methodologies for the data collection and aggregation are detailed in the Census report by Nagle et al (2022).\n\n2 OSS usage licenses vary a great deal and while some licenses are very open and allow the code to be reused in any manner, including within proprietary code that will be made available for sale at a non-zero price, other licenses restrict reuse to only be allowed if the resultant code is released under the same OSS license (known as copyleft). A detailed discussion of OSS licenses can be found in Lerner and Tirole (2005) and Almeida et al (2017).\n\n3 Indirect OSS usage is captured by dependency analysis and is necessary to accurately measure the full breadth of the OSS a firm relies on. For example, if a firm's proprietary code calls OSS package A, but package A, in turn, calls package B, then only looking at the direct calls would miss that package B was a required building block for the firm's proprietary code.\n\n4 The Census defines an OSS package as 'a unit of software that can be installed and managed by a package manager,' and  defines  a  package  manager  as  'software  that  automates  the  process  of  installing  and  otherwise  managing packages' (Nagle et al, 2022).\n\nreported from the three of the most prominent SCA vendors to identify the most widely used OSS rather  than  the  long-tail  of  the  usage  distribution.  This  led  to  packages  with  less  than  five observations  of  usage  being  dropped.  Since  packages  written  in  the  JavaScript  programming language, and usually hosted on the Node Package Manager (NPM), are generally smaller (fewer lines  of  code)  than  packages  in  other  languages  and  therefore  frequently  have  higher  usage numbers (since developers must include many small packages instead of a few large packages), the Census separately selected the top 1,000 NPM packages and the top 1,000 non-NPM hosted packages.\n\nThis final dataset covers 70% of the total usage of OSS observed in the raw data of the census.   For  each  of  these  2,000  OSS  packages  in  the  Census,  we  identified  the  raw  code 5 maintained on GitHub, the most widely used platform for hosting OSS.  We first attempted to 6 obtain the GitHub repository uniform resource locator (URL) for each package from libraries.io. We were able to match 1,657 packages to repositories via this initial method.  For URLs without 7 a  matching  repository,  we  performed  Google  searches  loosely  following  the  method  in  Singh (2020). More specifically, for each unmatched package, we used the Google API to search for the package name and 'GitHub Repository' and treated the first GitHub repository URL in the results as  its  best  matched  GitHub  URL.   This  resulted  in  an  additional  174  packages  matched  to  a 8 repository. Finally, we manually searched for URLs for the remaining 169 packages to identify the relevant repository. This entire process resulted in matching 1,840 out of the 2,000 Census packages to a code repository with the raw source code for the package. The unmatched packages were determined to have been either removed from GitHub or became proprietary (and thus the original source code was no longer available) and hence, the manual search allowed us to drop\n\n5 The packages that made up the remaining 30% of the full Census data in the long-tail usage distribution were not shared in the final report and therefore cannot be included in our analysis.\n\n6 GitHub  is  a  hosting  and  collaboration  platform  that  contributors  can  use  to  coordinate  the  development  and distribution of OSS projects. Founded in 2008, GitHub has become the largest hub for OSS development in the world. In January 2023, GitHub had more than 370 million repositories and over 100 million developers. In addition to personal users, a wide range of private firms actively use the GitHub platform, including Microsoft (which bought GitHub in 2018), Facebook, Google, and numerous other small and large firms.\n\n7 We attempted to access all repository URLs obtained as a sanity check to ensure they are in working condition. For those we could not access on GitHub, we manually found the correct URLs.\n\n8 As a robustness check, we randomly selected 50 package-repository matches derived from the Google Search method and we checked them by hand. All matches were manually confirmed to be correct providing additional support for the automated matching method.\n\nthese 160 unmatched packages (less than 8% of the Census sample of 2,000) with high confidence from our analysis.\n\nBuiltWith. The BuiltWith data contains scans of all public websites across the globe and identifies the technologies they use. Unlike the inward facing Census data which focus on the usage of OSS, the BuiltWith data scan for the use of both proprietary and OSS in firm websites without explicit differentiation. To separate OSS from proprietary software in BuiltWith, we turn to the subset of all open source web development software in the technology category that includes \"JavaScript and its libraries,\" which generates 778 observations corresponding to the NPM OSS category  in  the  Census  data.  There  are  two  reasons  for  this  sampling  choice.  First,  this  given category is constructed by BuiltWith and we use it as a proxy for OSS to separate it from pecuniary software.  Second,  JavaScript,  one  of  the  core  technologies  for  building  websites,  is  the  most popular programming language by usage on GitHub (GitHub, 2022) and thus enables us to capture the most important OSS from the demand side perspective. The scans include 8.8 million unique websites and 72.8 million corresponding observations of OSS usage from January 1 to November 16, 2020. Further, to ensure that we measure the value of OSS usage generated by the private sector,  we  match  the  adopting  domains  of  the  JavaScript-related  OSS  from  BuiltWith  with company websites recorded in Orbis, Compustat, and PitchBook, three commonly used databases of corporate activity that capture registered businesses across the world. Performing this match ensures that OSS used by non-commercial websites (e.g., an individual person's personal website) is excluded in our analysis. This results in a match-rate of 38.6%, which corresponds to around 3.4 million websites of distinct firms.\n\nFor the BuiltWith data, we cannot employ the first method we use for the Census (using libraries.io to help identify the repository URL) since only the technology names associated with the  packages  were  provided  by  BuiltWith,  and  other  information  (e.g.,  package  and  package manager  names)  is  not  included. 9 Hence,  we  start  by  performing  the  Google  Search  method mentioned above which results in a match of 695 packages to repositories. We then manually searched the Github URLs for 83 of the remaining unmatched packages, resulting in an addition of 46 packages. In total, for the BuiltWith data we were able to identify 741 out of 778 package-\n\n9 Since the package and package manager names are missing, a precise match using libraries.io was not feasible. Technology names are product names intended for customers and can be less technical and precise than the package names for internal development purposes. Thus, using technology names in a libraries.io search could cause significant ambiguity.\n\nrepository matches. As with the Census data, the remaining 37 unmatched packages (less than 5%) are dropped from our analysis because they had been deleted from GitHub.\n\nGHTorrent database. To obtain measures of the dispersion of the OSS value creation, we utilize  the  GHTorrent  database,  which  contains  the  entire  activity  history  on  GitHub  using GitHub's Representational State Transfer (REST) application programming interface (API). We leveraged  its  records  of  GitHub  repositories,  developer-level  commits,  and  developer  public profile information to estimate the contribution of each developer. We narrowed the sample for our developer contribution analysis in two steps. First, we winnowed the GitHub repositories and their  commits  from  GHTorrent  based  on  the  repository  URLs  of  our  joint  Census-BuiltWith sample. 10 Second, we focus on human contributions to OSS by removing approximately eight thousand (12%) GitHub contributors that we considered to be robots. 11 The final sample contains around sixty thousand developers and 2.3 million commits.\n\nTo prepare these three datasets for estimation, we first identified the number of lines of code and the programming languages used for each package using the OSS packages pygount (to count  the  number  of  lines  of  code)  and  linguist  (to  identify  programming  languages). 12 We categorize each distinct language into one of three different buckets moving from more likely human-written to more likely machine-written (see Table A1). Bucket 1 contains programming and markup languages (which are most likely to be human-written), bucket 3 contains data (most likely to be machine-written), and bucket 2 contains anything in between, such as config files and batch processing (which are sometimes human-written and sometimes machine-written, but it is difficult to tell based purely on looking at the code). 13 For our primary estimation we only use bucket 1 while providing robustness checks for buckets 2 and 3 in the Appendix, and thus our results represent a lower bound. Finally, for some analyses we dig deeper and show the top 5 programming languages (as classified by GitHub, 2022 for the year 2020; the year our data is from). The top 5 programming languages contain C (including C# and C++), Java, JavaScript,\n\n10 The match rate is over 96%, with the unmatched repositories accounting for only 0.15% of our calculated OSS demand value discussed below.\n\n11 The filtering is based on the 'fake user' classification by GHTorrent, as well as any usernames containing words 'bot' or 'robot', surrounded by special characters. This method is more conservative than other methods of bot detection  like  that  used  in  the  GitHub  Innovation  Graph  (https:\/\/innovationgraph.github.com\/),  which  rely  on  a monthly commit frequency threshold.\n\n12 https:\/\/pypi.org\/project\/pygount\/ and https:\/\/github.com\/github-linguist\/linguist\n\n13 Note that our focus is the cost to recreate OSS code written by humans, not robots. However, directly removing all OSS contributions from robot accounts is infeasible here, because we cannot observe the exact lines of code written by the robot accounts on GitHub.\n\nPython, and Typescript. We also add Go to this list of top languages since it is an increasingly widely used language in OSS.\n\nDocument 16: ## 5. Conclusion\n\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith. We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average value and distributed it across industries.\n\nIn this study we estimate the value of widely-used open source software globally with two unique datasets: the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data. We are able to estimate not only the supply side value of existing code (e.g., the cost it would take to rewrite each piece of widely-used OSS once) but also the demand side value for the private economy (e.g., the cost it would take for each company that uses a piece of OSS to rewrite it). While we do not focus on the long tail of OSS, we consider this an additional contribution of our study as focusing on OSS that is widely used allows us to more precisely understand the value created by OSS, rather than only measuring the  replacement  cost  for  all  OSS  (which  would  overestimate  the  true  value  since  many  OSS projects are not used in production code). However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n\nAdjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.  We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves.  Over  95%  percent  of  the  demand-side  value  is  generated  by  only  five  percent  of programmers, and those programmers contribute not only to a few widely used projects but to substantially more projects than the programmers that are engaged at the lower end of the value distribution.\n\nIn aggregate, our results show the substantial value that OSS contributes to the economy despite this value generally showing up as zero via direct measurement since prices equal zero and quantity is difficult to measure using public data alone. Our research lays the groundwork for future studies of not only OSS, but of all IT and its growing impact on the global economy.\n\nDocument 6: ## 1. Introduction\n\nIn 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that 'software is eating the world' (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that 'open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,' (Jacks, 2022). Other recent studies have come to similar conclusions showing that open source software  (OSS)  -  software  whose  source  code  is  publicly  available  for  inspection,  use,  and modification and is often created in a decentralized manner and distributed for free - appears in 96% of codebases (Synopsys 2023), and that some commercial software consists of up to 99.9% freely available OSS (Musseau et al., 2022). Although in its early days OSS frequently copied features from existing proprietary software, OSS today includes cutting edge technology in various fields including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, big data, and analytics.  However, despite the increasing importance of OSS to all software (and therefore to the entire economy), measuring its impact has been elusive. Traditionally, to measure the value created by a good or service,  economists  multiply  the  price  ( p )  times  the  quantity  sold  ( q ).  However,  in  OSS, p is generally zero since the source code is publicly available, and q is  unknown due to the limited number of restrictions around how the code may be copied and reused. For example, if a company downloads  a  piece  of  OSS  from  a  public  code  repository,  it  may  copy  it  thousands  of  times internally (legally) and then share it with suppliers or customers (also legally), so public download data is insufficient. Although some recent studies have sought to estimate the value of p (discussed below), data for estimating q has been unavailable or intractable for anything more than just a handful of OSS packages. Using newly collected data from multiple sources, the goal of this paper is to provide estimates for both p and q and to use those to shine light on the question: What is the value of open source software?\n\nUnderstanding the value of OSS is of critical importance not only due to the role it plays in the economy, but also due to it being one of the most successful and impactful modern examples of the centuries old economic concept of 'the commons' which run the risk of meeting the fate known as 'the tragedy of the commons.' This concept can trace its roots as far back as the 4 th -century BC philosopher Aristotle who wrote 'That which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care. Men pay most attention to what is their own and care less for what is common.'  (Aristotle,  1981).  William  Forster  Lloyd  (1833)  resurfaced  the  idea  in  modern economic thought by highlighting the example of shared tracts of land used for cattle grazing by\n\nmultiple cattle herders who each had an incentive to overuse the shared resource. Garrett Hardin (1968)  brought  the  concept  into  the  broader  zeitgeist  when  he  wrote  an  article  discussing  the problem entitled 'The Tragedy of the Commons.' Building on this work, Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for her research highlighting paths to avoiding the tragedy of the commons through community coordination efforts that did not necessitate government enforced laws to manage and guard the commons (Ostrom 1990). The parallels between shared grazing lands and shared digital infrastructure are palpable - the availability of communal grass to feed cattle, and in turn feed people, was critical to the agrarian economy, and the ability to not have to recreate code that someone else has already written is critical to the modern economy. Further, in both contexts, despite knowing grass and code are critical inputs to the economy, measuring their actual value is difficult. And, as the renowned mathematician and physicist Lord Kelvin is believed to have said, 'If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.' And if you cannot improve and maintain it, such common goods may crumble under the weight of their own success as they are overused, but underinvested in (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021). Therefore, measuring the value OSS creates is crucial to the future health of the digital economy, and the rest of the economy that is built on top of it.\n\nImportantly, recent studies have attempted to address these measurement issues but fall short of capturing both the breadth and depth of OSS usage - a gap we seek to fill with this paper. For example, researchers have attempted to gain breadth by using novel methodologies to estimate the labor replacement value of the current corpus of OSS created in the United States at $38 billion in 2019 (Robbins et al., 2021) and that created in the European Union at €1 billion (Blind et al., 2021) by imputing the labor costs that it would have taken to rewrite existing OSS. Such efforts do a very good job at estimating what it would cost to replace all existing OSS if it disappeared tomorrow. However, the resultant estimates rely on two important assumptions. First, that all OSS is equally valuable from a usage standpoint, and second that the concept of OSS would still exist, and society would just need to rewrite the code once, thus addressing the aforementioned problem of a missing value for p , but not addressing the missing value of q . In a world where OSS did not exist at all, then each piece of OSS software would not need to be rewritten just once, but instead would need to be rewritten by every firm that used the software (assuming the firm could freely share the software within its boundaries). Other research (Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; MurcianoGoroff, Zhuo, and Greenstein, 2021) has gone deeper into this hypothetical, albeit in a narrow\n\nmanner, by only focusing on web servers (which are public facing on the Internet and can therefore be readily measured). Using different methods, both studies measure q for this one type of software and impute p by using a goods replacement value approach based on the prices for closed-source alternatives offered by firms. With data from the United States the resulting estimates show a value of  $2  billion  for  the  OSS  Apache  Web  Server  in  2012  (Greenstein  and  Nagle,  2014)  and  a combined value of $4.5 billion for Apache and the increasingly popular OSS web server nginx in 2018 (Murciano-Goroff, et al., 2021). However, although web servers are an important part of the OSS  ecosystem,  they  constitute  a  small  portion  of  it.  We  seek  to  build  upon  the  important contributions this existing research has made in an attempt to go both broad and deep to create a more complete measure of the value of OSS.\n\nTo consider the value of OSS in both a broad and deep manner, we use data from two primary sources that allow us to gain insights into the OSS used at tens of thousands of firms across the world. The first is the 'Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries' (Nagle et al., 2022). The Census II project utilized partnerships with multiple software composition analysis (SCA) firms to create various lists of the most widely used OSS. SCAs are hired to scan the codebases of a company to ensure they are not violating any OSS licenses and, as a byproduct, track all the OSS code used by their customers and the products they build. The Census II project aggregated data from multiple SCAs to build a dataset of OSS usage at tens of thousands of firms based  on  millions  of  data  points  (observations  of  OSS  usage).  The  second  data  source  is  the BuiltWith dataset, from which we leverage scans of nearly nine million websites to identify the underlying technology deployed by these websites, including OSS libraries. The BuiltWith data has been used in multiple academic studies (DeStefano &amp; Timmis 2023, Dushnitsky &amp; Stroube 2021, Koning et al.. 2022), but to our knowledge this is the first one to focus on OSS usage. The Census II data and the BuiltWith data are complementary as the former focuses on OSS that is built  into  the  software  a  company  sells,  while  the  latter  focuses  on  OSS  that  is  built  into  a company's website, thus reducing the chances of double-counting observations across the datasets. In aggregate, these two datasets combined create the most complete measurement of OSS usage ( q ) to date. Further, by focusing on OSS that is widely deployed and used by firms, rather than considering all the projects that exist in an OSS repository, we enhance the methodologies of prior studies by reducing the likelihood of measurement error stemming from projects that are posted as publicly available OSS but are not actually used in any practical manner. Not accounting for this\n\nmeasurement error would lead to overestimation of the actual value of OSS as projects that are widely used would be valued in the same way as projects that are not used at all.\n\nTo estimate p ,  we  follow  the  literature  discussed  above  and  use  the  labor  replacement value. First, we calculate the labor cost it would take an individual firm to recreate a given OSS package by measuring the number of lines of code within the package and then applying the Constructive Cost Model II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) - also known as COCOMO II to estimate the number of person-hours it would take to write the code from scratch. We then utilize global wage data from Salary Expert to get an accurate estimate of the labor costs a firm would incur if this piece of OSS did not exist. These costs can be combined with the q values from above at the OSS package level to estimate the combined value of all OSS from both the supply and demand sides.\n\nWe find a value ranging from $1.22 billion to $6.22 billion if we were to decide as a society to recreate all widely used OSS on the supply side. However, considering the actual usage of OSS leads to a demand-side value that is orders of magnitude larger and ranges from $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion, if each firm who used an OSS package had to recreate it from scratch (e.g., the concept of OSS did not exist). We document substantial heterogeneity of the value of OSS by programming  language  and  internal  vs  outward-facing  programming  efforts.  Further,  we  find considerable  heterogeneity  in  value  contributions  by  programmers  as  5%  of  programmers  are responsible for more than 90% of the value created on the supply- and demand- side. The data we use is arguably the most comprehensive source of data to measure the value created by firm usage of OSS at this time. However, as for any project, the evidence is not complete and we argue that we underestimate the value since our data, e.g., does not include operating systems, which are a substantial omitted category of OSS.\n\nThis study makes four important contributions to the academic literature, practitioners, and policy makers. First, it provides the most complete estimate of the value of widely used OSS to date  by  accounting  for  not  only  the  supply-side  of  OSS  (price  to  create  it),  but  also  for  the usage\/demand-side at a scale that has not been done before. While prior estimates of the value of OSS only went either broad (estimating the supply-side costs of a large swath of OSS) or deep (estimating the value created by one particular type of OSS), this study does both by using unique datasets that allow for a better understanding of the breadth and depth of OSS usage. Further, rather than measuring the value of all OSS, this study focuses on the value of OSS that is used by firms\n\nto create its products and websites, limiting the measurement error occurring in studies that are unable to account for which OSS is actually used in production. This contribution builds upon, and extends, important research (e.g., Blind et al., 2021; Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021; Robbins et al., 2021) that has sought to identify the value of this vital resource that contributes a great deal to the modern economy despite the difficulties measuring this contribution. In  doing  so,  it  adds  insights  to  a  long-running  discussion  related  to  the  impact  of  information technology (IT) on productivity (Brynjolfsson, 1993; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 1996; Nagle, 2019a; Solow, 1987) known as the 'productivity paradox' where IT investments can have limited impact on productivity statistics. This debate has continued into the emerging context of AI (Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson, 2018). Our work contributes to this conversation by highlighting a massive societal level cost-savings (and hence productivity enhancement) that is created by the existence of OSS.\n\nSecond, our research contributes methodological advances to the study of intangible capital by highlighting novel sources of data related to investments in OSS. Prior research has shown that intangible capital plays an increasingly important role in economic growth (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel,  2009)  and  firm  value  (Peters  and  Taylor,  2017),  but  it  often  goes  unmeasured  or misattributed (Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou, 2014). Further, we demonstrate how these data sources can be used to understand the true investments in software that a firm makes, and that which they would have to make if OSS did not exist.  This  is  valuable  as  investments  in  software  are  an increasingly important type of intangible capital that is driving innovation (Branstetter, Drev, and Kwon, 2019) and performance (Krishnan et al., 2000).\n\nThird, our results help highlight for firms and managers the importance of OSS to their production, and ideally add weight to arguments that users of OSS should not just free ride but also contribute to the creation and maintenance of OSS (e.g., Henkel, 2008; Nagle, 2018). Such contributions are a fraction of the costs that firms would incur if OSS did not exist and the active participation of OSS users in helping maintain the OSS they use is critical to the health and future well-being of the OSS ecosystem (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021; Zhang et al., 2019).\n\nFourth,  and  finally,  our  study  helps  inform  policymakers  who  have  recently  started  to understand  the  growing  importance  of  OSS  to  the  economy  and  taken  actions  to  support  the ecosystem (European Commission, 2020; Executive Order No. 14028, 2021). However, most of these efforts are related to securing the existing OSS ecosystem, which is quite important, but do\n\nnot go as far as supporting the creation of new OSS. Our results help shine light on the importance of OSS to the overall economy and add weight to calls for more societal support of this critical resource. Our results further show that the majority of the value created by OSS is created by a small  number  of  contributors.  Although  it  has  long  been  known  that  a  small  number  of  OSS contributors do most of the work, we add new insights that show this is even more true for the value creation of widely-used OSS projects and that societal support for these individuals is critical to the future success of OSS, and in turn, the economy.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the empirical setting and data. Section 3 discusses the methods including measurement challenges. In section 4, we estimate the value of open source software. Section 5 concludes.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"complex","seed_document_id":7,"topic":"Others"}}

Methodology\n\nWe first measure the value of OSS by considering the supply and the demand side of OSS using a labor market approach. 14 The thought experiment is that we live in a world where OSS does not exist and has to be recreated at each firm that uses a given piece of OSS. Using the labor market approach, we calculate the labor replacement cost of each OSS package. To estimate the value for each package, we use COCOMO II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) at the individual package level and then sum across all package values to obtain a supply-side labor market replacement value. Then, we scale the supply-side value by the number of times firms are using each package while removing multi-usage within each firm to obtain a demand-side value.\n\nSecond, we move beyond the aggregate and inspect inequality in the value creation process. In OSS, as with many creative endeavors, it is common that a small handful of individuals provide the bulk of the contributions, while many others make small contributions (sometimes referred to as the 80\/20 rule, implying 80% of the work is done by 20% of the people). Research has shown these frequent contributors often attain positions of influence in OSS communities as a result of their efforts (Hanisch, et al, 2018). Therefore, to better understand the dispersion of value creation across developers, we first use the GHTorrent data and identify individual developer contributions in two ways: a) through their OSS value contributions directly and b) through the total number of repositories they contributed to. We then test how concentrated these two contribution measures are to better understand whether many or few developers contribute to the total value we measure. We explain the exact details for the labor market approach and the inequality of valuations below.\n\nDocument 9: ## 3.1 Labor market approach\n\nFor the labor market approach, we estimate the value of OSS by calculating the replacement value of a package. We ask how much it would cost to reproduce the package by hiring a programmer and paying them a competitive market wage. To estimate this supply-side value ( 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; ) , we take the complete list of OSS packages discussed above, and then count the lines of code in each unique\n\n14 In an alternative version, we use a mixture of a labor and goods market approach that is more closely aligned with Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff, et al (2021). However, applying this method in our setting requires numerous additional assumptions due to data constraints. For simplicity we call it the goods market approach for which we provide the details and statistics, as well as the limitations in Appendix A.\n\npackage. 15 For each unique package,  , we calculate the value and then sum over all these values i to obtain the total value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nIn this calculation, we implicitly do not incorporate any production externalities since we assume that there is no spillover knowledge from one package to the next that would lower the cost of programming. 16 This methodology is similar to that used by other papers that estimate the supply-side costs of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021).\n\nWe then calculate the demand-side value of OSS by incorporating the usage information ( Q) for each package:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nHere, we do not incorporate consumption externalities, i.e., we do not allow a benefit to arise for the general public when a package has been created and we further make sure that each firm is only replacing a package they use once, since a replaced package can be used within a firm as a club good (e.g., see Cornes and Sandler, 1996). The value 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost to rewrite all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the concept of OSS still exists, but all of these packages needed to be rewritten from scratch), while the value 𝑉 + \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost for each firm that uses one of these OSS packages to pay a developer to rewrite those packages (e.g., OSS itself no longer exists).\n\nFor both the supply and demand models, we obtain the dollar-value for each package ( 𝑃 ( ) via the Constructive Cost Model II, also abbreviated as COCOMO II (Boehm 1984, Boehm et al. 2009). The model has previously been used by the United States Department of Defense to estimate software project costs as well as in prior research estimating the value of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021). It is a highly flexible model that allows us to create non-linear transformations of lines of code to dollar-values. It uses the following modelling equation:\n\n15 We use only the pure lines of code excluding documentation lines and empty lines. Hence, we underestimate the true value of recreating each package.\n\n16 Similar to a representative agent model (e.g. see Williamson 2006), one may think of each package being reproduced by separate programmers who are identical replicas of each other (and therefore have the same skill level, but do not become more efficient via learning).\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n( (\n\nwhere 𝐿 represents the lines of codes in thousands and E the effort in person-month units for each project  . Consistent with Blind et al. (2021), we use the default parameter values for i 𝛼 , 𝛽 and 𝜂. The parameters 𝛼 𝛽 , are non-linear adjustment factors set to 2.94, and 1.0997 respectively . The parameter 𝜂 is an effort-adjustment factor which can be modified to incorporate subjective assessments of product, hardware, personnel, and project attributes. Since we do not have a prior for each project, we set 𝜂 to the default value of one. To obtain the price ( 𝑃 ( ) of each OSS project, we  then  multiply  the  results  of  equation  (3)  by  the  weighted  global  wage  that  an  average programmer would obtain on the open market. To calculate a global wage, we include the base monthly salaries of software developers from Salary Expert for the top 30 countries in terms of their GitHub developer counts in 2021 (Wachs et al., 2022). 17 The weight of each country is its share of active GitHub contributors over the total contributors in the top 30 countries. We further create bounds by using a low-wage (India) and high-wage (USA) labor market for the wage to better understand how the value would vary by the pool of programmers used to recreate all of OSS. 18\n\nDocument 11: ## 4. Results\n\nAfter applying the labor market approach using COCOMO II, we obtain global estimates for the value of OSS. To calculate the overall value, we first need the underlying number of lines of code (to calculate the supply-side value) and then the usage statistics (for the demand-side value). Since there may be substantial heterogeneity in value by programming languages, we also show the top programming languages during our investigation period in the year 2020, as discussed above.\n\nDocument 21: ## Appendix A) Goods-Market Valuation Approach\n\nAs an alternate estimation method, instead of using the labor replacement cost, we use a goods replacement value approach. We identify several OSS packages that have similar closed-source, pecuniary alternatives and consider the costs if all commercial users of the free OSS had to replace that software with a pecuniary alternative (similar to the calculations Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) performed for web servers). We can then use this alternate value of p , combined with the q values from above to estimate a goods replacement value of OSS. This method builds on suggestions from Nordhaus (2006, p. 146) who says '…the price of market and nonmarket goods and services should be imputed on the basis of the comparable market goods and services.' We do not expect the estimates from the two methods to be similar. Quite the contrary, the value of those two methods varies substantially since the latter goods-market approach assumes a fixed price to sell a good multiple times and that fixed price is usually lower than the total value estimated from recreating all packages on the labor side. The differential between these estimates is  essentially the result of a firm stepping in to reproduce the missing OSS packages and then selling them for a pecuniary price rather than all firms needing to reproduce those packages from scratch themselves.\n\nWith the goods market approach, the thought experiment is still that we live in a world where OSS does not exist, but it has to be recreated via one firm that then charges a price for a good that is currently free. To value OSS via the goods market approach, we created a basket of equivalent substitute proprietary goods that are priced on the open market as a stand-in for an OSS product.  This  methodology  is  consistent  with  that  used  in  the  prior  literature  (Greenstein  and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021) although both of those studies only used a single good rather than a basket since they were focused on only one type of OSS (web servers). Since there is no readily available database for proprietary equivalents of OSS, we conduct a search based on subjective  perception  of  popularity  of  OSS  and  we  then  search  for  pecuniary,  closed-source substitutes for them. The resulting basket of 20 OSS packages with proprietary substitutes is a good representation of the diversity of OSS. The software ranges from media and design software to statistical analysis programs, to database management and web server software. 21\n\n21 Table A5 shows the basket of OSS and their proprietary equivalents that we used. To create this basket, we looked for proprietary software that had an OSS equivalent that was similar in its overall function and feature set, and sought to identify pairs of software that, in aggregate, captured a broad and representative set of the types of OSS that exist.\n\nBased on our OSS equivalent substitute proprietary goods basket we then obtain prices for each proprietary software equivalent and we calculated the COCOMO labor market supply-side value for each OSS product in the basket which we use as a proxy - for lack of the code from the proprietary software - for the COCOMO labor supply side value of the proprietary software (e.g., the cost it would take to pay a programmer to write that proprietary software from scratch). We then calculate the average COCOMO labor supply-side value of the basket, 𝑉 !,1#23.4 ,  and  the average price for the basket, 𝑃 !,1#23.4 . 22 Since, we know the labor market supply-side value of all OSS, 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; , we can setup the following equation and obtain the price of OSS, 𝑃 ! for the goodsmarket for all OSS via a simple scaling transformation:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nThis results in the following goods-market supply-side value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nWe can then obtain the equivalent demand-side goods-market values as follows:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nFrom the goods market side, we consider the equivalent price that a firm would charge if it produced all existing widely used OSS and then sold it as a product to customers.\n\nTable A6, column 3 shows that the value on the demand side ranges between $177 million and $244 million across the different buckets independent of the country of origin from which programmers are hired. Naturally, the goods-market value will be substantially smaller than the labor demand value since this imaginary firm will make a profit at a comparatively low price by producing the software once and then selling it to many customers. Further, while Greenstein and Nagle (2014) as well as Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) focus on one particular type of software only (web servers), we attempt to expand on their approach to many goods. However, the data limitations become a stronger constraint in this context which makes it inherently more difficult\n\n22 We obtained the average price of the goods-market proprietary basket by using a 3 years lifespan of software, i.e. 1\/(1-0.66), so the depreciation factor is 0.33. This is consistent with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules for depreciating software, which states 'If you can depreciate the cost of computer software, use the straight line method over a useful life of 36 months.' https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/publications\/p946#en\\_US\\_2022\\_publink1000107354.\n\nto  estimate  the  value  through  this  approach  while  requiring  substantially  more  assumptions. Instead of a pure goods-market approach, this requires assistance from the labor-market approach in terms of scaling for the estimate, which ultimately leads to a substantial underestimate of the value of OSS. Further, the pricing strategy of the proprietary software counterparts is sensitive to the  market  demand.  With  the  goods-market  approach  extending  to  multiple  goods,  the  strong implicit assumption is that the market demands for our basket software and our sample OSS are similar, so they lead to commensurate prices.\n\nAn alternative and even more simplified goods-market back-of-the-envelope calculation that does not account for lines of code and relies on no scaling from the labor market approach would simply be to multiply a price of a reference good with the usage. We can take the minimum, average, and maximum prices of the basket of proprietary goods as captured in the reference price vector p = (69.99, 1610.17, 5800) and simply multiply it with usage from the combined Census and BuiltWith sample (Table 1). Based on those imputed proprietary price assumptions, the goods market demand side value would range from $0.2 - $16.5 trillion (minimum price - maximum price)  with  the  mean  price  resulting  in  a  value  estimate  of  $4.5  trillion.  However,  while  this estimate creates slightly more variance than the labor market approach, it is inherently flawed by simply assuming that the imputed prices are identical for each open source product based on the reference price. We further think this very simple back-of-the-envelope is an orange to apples comparison since the goods in our basket are fully functional, stand-alone software packages, while the packages in the Census and BuiltWith datasets are comprised of application libraries, which are generally smaller than such stand-alone packages.\n\nGiven all the complexities and assumptions one has to make due to lack of data for a goodsmarket approach, we place stronger emphasis on the labor cost approach highlighted in the main body but we include this method here for completeness.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"complex","seed_document_id":8,"topic":"Others"}}

Consistent with Blind et al. (2021), we use the default parameter values for i 𝛼 , 𝛽 and 𝜂. The parameters 𝛼 𝛽 , are non-linear adjustment factors set to 2.94, and 1.0997 respectively . The parameter 𝜂 is an effort-adjustment factor which can be modified to incorporate subjective assessments of product, hardware, personnel, and project attributes. Since we do not have a prior for each project, we set 𝜂 to the default value of one. To obtain the price ( 𝑃 ( ) of each OSS project, we  then  multiply  the  results  of  equation  (3)  by  the  weighted  global  wage  that  an  average programmer would obtain on the open market. To calculate a global wage, we include the base monthly salaries of software developers from Salary Expert for the top 30 countries in terms of their GitHub developer counts in 2021 (Wachs et al., 2022). 17 The weight of each country is its share of active GitHub contributors over the total contributors in the top 30 countries. We further create bounds by using a low-wage (India) and high-wage (USA) labor market for the wage to better understand how the value would vary by the pool of programmers used to recreate all of OSS. 18\n\nDocument 8: ## 3. Methodology\n\nWe first measure the value of OSS by considering the supply and the demand side of OSS using a labor market approach. 14 The thought experiment is that we live in a world where OSS does not exist and has to be recreated at each firm that uses a given piece of OSS. Using the labor market approach, we calculate the labor replacement cost of each OSS package. To estimate the value for each package, we use COCOMO II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) at the individual package level and then sum across all package values to obtain a supply-side labor market replacement value. Then, we scale the supply-side value by the number of times firms are using each package while removing multi-usage within each firm to obtain a demand-side value.\n\nSecond, we move beyond the aggregate and inspect inequality in the value creation process. In OSS, as with many creative endeavors, it is common that a small handful of individuals provide the bulk of the contributions, while many others make small contributions (sometimes referred to as the 80\/20 rule, implying 80% of the work is done by 20% of the people). Research has shown these frequent contributors often attain positions of influence in OSS communities as a result of their efforts (Hanisch, et al, 2018). Therefore, to better understand the dispersion of value creation across developers, we first use the GHTorrent data and identify individual developer contributions in two ways: a) through their OSS value contributions directly and b) through the total number of repositories they contributed to. We then test how concentrated these two contribution measures are to better understand whether many or few developers contribute to the total value we measure. We explain the exact details for the labor market approach and the inequality of valuations below.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"complex","seed_document_id":11,"topic":"Others"}}

The  inward-facing Census  (Panel  A)  contains  just  over  261.7  million  lines  of  code  with  72%  of  the  lines  being attributable to the top programming languages. The average package includes 142 thousand lines of code with a slightly lower average of 113 thousand lines of code for the subset of top languages. When considering the demand (usage) side, we observe that the Census packages were used over 2.7 million times while 92% of this usage is attributable to the top languages. The average package was used 1,472.4 times with a higher usage of around 1,497.5 for the top  languages.  For  the outward-facing  BuiltWith  data  we  find  similar  patterns,  but  at  different  levels.  The  packages included from BuiltWith include over 82 million lines of code, 71% of which are attributable to the  top  programming  languages.  The  average  package  within  the  BuiltWith  sample  has  111 thousand  lines  of  code  with  a  lower  average  of  around  80  thousand  lines  of  code  for  the  top languages. This is because our BuiltWith data primarily consists of JavaScript-based packages, which are often smaller than packages written in other languages. BuiltWith packages were used over 142 thousand times where 99.97% were attributable to the top languages. Next, we used these raw observations to calculate the value of all OSS through the labor market approach and estimated the value created from the supply and demand side.\n\n--- Table 2 about here ---\n\nTable 2 shows the estimates for the value of OSS based on the firm-relevant joint Census and BuiltWith sample. All estimates in Table 2 are based only on software languages classified in bucket  1  from  Table  A1,  which  are  the  most  likely  to  be  written  by  a  human  rather  than  a machine. 19 The first column contains estimates with wages from a low income country (India), the global  average  wage,  and  a  high  income  country  (United  States  of  America),  respectively  (as described above). To reproduce all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the idea of OSS still exists, but all current OSS is deleted and needs to be coded from scratch), using programmers at the average developer wage from India, it would require an investment of $1.22 billion. In contrast, if we use the average developer wage from the United States, then reproducing all widely-used OSS would require  an  investment  of  $6.22  billion.  Using  a  pool  of  programmers  from  across  the  world, weighed based on the existing geographic contributions to OSS as discussed above, would lead to an investment somewhere in between the low and high-income country, $4.15 billion. It is useful to compare these numbers to those from similar studies to understand differences in valuing all OSS (prior studies) versus that which is widely used (our study). Robbins et al. (2021) and Blind et al. (2021) use a method similar to ours and estimate that the value of OSS created in the US is $38 billion in 2019 and that created in the EU is €1 billion in 2018. Wachs et al. (2022) show that roughly 50% of OSS contributions come from the US and EU combined. In aggregate, that would lead these studies to give a global value of OSS of $78 billion. Thus, our middle estimate of a supply-side value of $4.15 billion for only firm-oriented and widely used OSS is a credible lowerbound and highlights the higher estimations of the total of supply-side value of OSS when not considering whether or not a given OSS package is widely used. This further indicates that the supply-side value of the most widely used OSS is roughly 5.5% of the supply-side value of all OSS.\n\nThe second column in Table 2 contains the demand side estimates based on the labor market approach. We find that if firms had to recreate all OSS packages they used (e.g., OSS itself no longer existed and every firm that used an OSS package had to recreate it), then the entire cost would amount to between $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion using labor from the low wage or high wage country only, respectively. A pool of programmers across the globe could recreate all of OSS that is being widely used for a cost of approximately $8.80 trillion. Interpreting this number is\n\n19 Tables in the appendix show the equivalent values from Table 2 when including software language buckets 1 and 2 (Table A3) and all three software language buckets (Table A4).\n\nslightly more complicated but still feasible. According to a Statista (2023) report, global software revenue in 2020 (the same year as our data) was $531.7 billion. However, this represents a flow, not a stock, of software. Relying on government estimates that software fully depreciates over three years, we can do a back of the envelope calculation and consider the purchase value of the full stock of prepackaged software used in 2020 as the aggregate of that sold from 2018 to 2020, which is $1.54 trillion. Further, this represents only the expenditure on prepackaged software and does  not  include  custom  purchased  or  in-house  developed  software.  Here,  the  best  obtainable estimates of private-sector investment in software overall come from the United States National Income and Product Accounts data (NIPA 2023). In 2020, the national account data shows that in the  US,  private  firms  spent  $479.2  billion  on  software,  of  which  45%  ($215.5  billion)  was prepackaged. If we assume this is a consistent ratio for the rest of the world, then the total amount firms spent on software being used in 2020 was $3.4 trillion (= $1.54 trillion\/0.45). Combining this rough estimate with the demand side estimate of the value of OSS based on an average global wage ($8.8 trillion), this indicates firms would spend $12.2 trillion (=$3.4 trillion + $8.8 trillion), or three and a half times what they currently spend if they needed to pay in-house developers to write the OSS that they currently use for free.\n\nDocument 14: ## --- Figure 2 about here ---\n\nFigure 2 splits the OSS value estimates for each language by our inward facing (Census) and outward facing (BuiltWith) data sources. Panel A and Panel B focus on the supply and demand side estimation for the Census. We obtain a similar pattern that has been established already in the aggregate when pooling both data sources (Figure 1) albeit the impact of JavaScript is substantially lower.  On  the  supply  side  of  the  Census  in  Panel  A,  Java  has  the  second-highest  value  while JavaScript  code  from  the  Census  contributes  to  a  substantially  lower  value  to  the  aggregate. Similarly, the supply side values of C, Python, and Typescript are mainly driven by the Census. From the demand side Panel B we find that Go is the most popular language for inward facing code while all other languages appear to be negligible in relative terms.\n\nFigure 2, Panel C and Panel D show the supply and demand side values for the BuiltWith dataset. The supply side value in Panel C clearly indicates that the value from the BuiltWith sample is driven by JavaScript code, which is a good sanity check since we focused on JavaScript packages to proxy for OSS in the BuiltWith sample, as discussed above. The second highest value is created by TypeScript which is reassuring since it is a superset of JavaScript. Panel D shows a similar pattern  on  the  usage  side  where  most  of  the  value  arises  from  JavaScript  while  TypeScript  is trailing at the second spot as well. The other languages contribute only marginal amounts to the supply and demand side values. Overall, these findings are broadly consistent with the main use cases of the various languages (web programming vs. application programming) and an idea that languages through which value are generated are not necessarily identical to languages that are used by the general public.\n\n--- Figure 3 about here ---\n\nFigure 3 shows the demand-side value of OSS across industries by NAICS 2-digit codes using the BuiltWith online data. 20 This can be interpreted as the value each of these industries receive because OSS exists. The industry with the highest usage value of around $43 billion is 'Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.' 'Retail Trade' as well as 'Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services' make up another large part of the demand-side externally facing value of OSS with $36 billion and $35 billion, respectively. In contrast, industries that constitute just a small portion of the value are 'Mining, Quarrying, and Oil  and  Gas  Extraction',  'Utilities',  'Agriculture,  Forestry,  Fishing,  and  Hunting.'  The  latter industries are classical non-service sector industries and as such software is expected to play less of a role there.\n\nDocument 16: ## 5. Conclusion\n\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith. We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average value and distributed it across industries.\n\nIn this study we estimate the value of widely-used open source software globally with two unique datasets: the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data. We are able to estimate not only the supply side value of existing code (e.g., the cost it would take to rewrite each piece of widely-used OSS once) but also the demand side value for the private economy (e.g., the cost it would take for each company that uses a piece of OSS to rewrite it). While we do not focus on the long tail of OSS, we consider this an additional contribution of our study as focusing on OSS that is widely used allows us to more precisely understand the value created by OSS, rather than only measuring the  replacement  cost  for  all  OSS  (which  would  overestimate  the  true  value  since  many  OSS projects are not used in production code). However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n\nAdjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.  We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves.  Over  95%  percent  of  the  demand-side  value  is  generated  by  only  five  percent  of programmers, and those programmers contribute not only to a few widely used projects but to substantially more projects than the programmers that are engaged at the lower end of the value distribution.\n\nIn aggregate, our results show the substantial value that OSS contributes to the economy despite this value generally showing up as zero via direct measurement since prices equal zero and quantity is difficult to measure using public data alone. Our research lays the groundwork for future studies of not only OSS, but of all IT and its growing impact on the global economy.\n\nDocument 9: ## 3.1 Labor market approach\n\nFor the labor market approach, we estimate the value of OSS by calculating the replacement value of a package. We ask how much it would cost to reproduce the package by hiring a programmer and paying them a competitive market wage. To estimate this supply-side value ( 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; ) , we take the complete list of OSS packages discussed above, and then count the lines of code in each unique\n\n14 In an alternative version, we use a mixture of a labor and goods market approach that is more closely aligned with Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff, et al (2021). However, applying this method in our setting requires numerous additional assumptions due to data constraints. For simplicity we call it the goods market approach for which we provide the details and statistics, as well as the limitations in Appendix A.\n\npackage. 15 For each unique package,  , we calculate the value and then sum over all these values i to obtain the total value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nIn this calculation, we implicitly do not incorporate any production externalities since we assume that there is no spillover knowledge from one package to the next that would lower the cost of programming. 16 This methodology is similar to that used by other papers that estimate the supply-side costs of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021).\n\nWe then calculate the demand-side value of OSS by incorporating the usage information ( Q) for each package:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nHere, we do not incorporate consumption externalities, i.e., we do not allow a benefit to arise for the general public when a package has been created and we further make sure that each firm is only replacing a package they use once, since a replaced package can be used within a firm as a club good (e.g., see Cornes and Sandler, 1996). The value 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost to rewrite all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the concept of OSS still exists, but all of these packages needed to be rewritten from scratch), while the value 𝑉 + \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost for each firm that uses one of these OSS packages to pay a developer to rewrite those packages (e.g., OSS itself no longer exists).\n\nFor both the supply and demand models, we obtain the dollar-value for each package ( 𝑃 ( ) via the Constructive Cost Model II, also abbreviated as COCOMO II (Boehm 1984, Boehm et al. 2009). The model has previously been used by the United States Department of Defense to estimate software project costs as well as in prior research estimating the value of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021). It is a highly flexible model that allows us to create non-linear transformations of lines of code to dollar-values. It uses the following modelling equation:\n\n15 We use only the pure lines of code excluding documentation lines and empty lines. Hence, we underestimate the true value of recreating each package.\n\n16 Similar to a representative agent model (e.g. see Williamson 2006), one may think of each package being reproduced by separate programmers who are identical replicas of each other (and therefore have the same skill level, but do not become more efficient via learning).\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n( (\n\nwhere 𝐿 represents the lines of codes in thousands and E the effort in person-month units for each project  .

We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average value and distributed it across industries.\n\nIn this study we estimate the value of widely-used open source software globally with two unique datasets: the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data. We are able to estimate not only the supply side value of existing code (e.g., the cost it would take to rewrite each piece of widely-used OSS once) but also the demand side value for the private economy (e.g., the cost it would take for each company that uses a piece of OSS to rewrite it). While we do not focus on the long tail of OSS, we consider this an additional contribution of our study as focusing on OSS that is widely used allows us to more precisely understand the value created by OSS, rather than only measuring the  replacement  cost  for  all  OSS  (which  would  overestimate  the  true  value  since  many  OSS projects are not used in production code). However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n\nAdjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.  We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves.  Over  95%  percent  of  the  demand-side  value  is  generated  by  only  five  percent  of programmers, and those programmers contribute not only to a few widely used projects but to substantially more projects than the programmers that are engaged at the lower end of the value distribution.\n\nIn aggregate, our results show the substantial value that OSS contributes to the economy despite this value generally showing up as zero via direct measurement since prices equal zero and quantity is difficult to measure using public data alone. Our research lays the groundwork for future studies of not only OSS, but of all IT and its growing impact on the global economy.\n\nDocument 9: ## 3.1 Labor market approach\n\nFor the labor market approach, we estimate the value of OSS by calculating the replacement value of a package. We ask how much it would cost to reproduce the package by hiring a programmer and paying them a competitive market wage. To estimate this supply-side value ( 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; ) , we take the complete list of OSS packages discussed above, and then count the lines of code in each unique\n\n14 In an alternative version, we use a mixture of a labor and goods market approach that is more closely aligned with Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff, et al (2021).

The value 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost to rewrite all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the concept of OSS still exists, but all of these packages needed to be rewritten from scratch), while the value 𝑉 + \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost for each firm that uses one of these OSS packages to pay a developer to rewrite those packages (e.g., OSS itself no longer exists).\n\nFor both the supply and demand models, we obtain the dollar-value for each package ( 𝑃 ( ) via the Constructive Cost Model II, also abbreviated as COCOMO II (Boehm 1984, Boehm et al. 2009).

It is a highly flexible model that allows us to create non-linear transformations of lines of code to dollar-values.

Panel A and Panel B focus on the supply and demand side estimation for the Census. We obtain a similar pattern that has been established already in the aggregate when pooling both data sources (Figure 1) albeit the impact of JavaScript is substantially lower.  On  the  supply  side  of  the  Census  in  Panel  A,  Java  has  the  second-highest  value  while JavaScript  code  from  the  Census  contributes  to  a  substantially  lower  value  to  the  aggregate. Similarly, the supply side values of C, Python, and Typescript are mainly driven by the Census. From the demand side Panel B we find that Go is the most popular language for inward facing code while all other languages appear to be negligible in relative terms.\n\nFigure 2, Panel C and Panel D show the supply and demand side values for the BuiltWith dataset. The supply side value in Panel C clearly indicates that the value from the BuiltWith sample is driven by JavaScript code, which is a good sanity check since we focused on JavaScript packages to proxy for OSS in the BuiltWith sample, as discussed above. The second highest value is created by TypeScript which is reassuring since it is a superset of JavaScript. Panel D shows a similar pattern  on  the  usage  side  where  most  of  the  value  arises  from  JavaScript  while  TypeScript  is trailing at the second spot as well. The other languages contribute only marginal amounts to the supply and demand side values. Overall, these findings are broadly consistent with the main use cases of the various languages (web programming vs. application programming) and an idea that languages through which value are generated are not necessarily identical to languages that are used by the general public.\n\n--- Figure 3 about here ---\n\nFigure 3 shows the demand-side value of OSS across industries by NAICS 2-digit codes using the BuiltWith online data. 20 This can be interpreted as the value each of these industries receive because OSS exists. The industry with the highest usage value of around $43 billion is 'Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.' 'Retail Trade' as well as 'Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services' make up another large part of the demand-side externally facing value of OSS with $36 billion and $35 billion, respectively. In contrast, industries that constitute just a small portion of the value are 'Mining, Quarrying, and Oil  and  Gas  Extraction',  'Utilities',  'Agriculture,  Forestry,  Fishing,  and  Hunting.'  The  latter industries are classical non-service sector industries and as such software is expected to play less of a role there.\n\nDocument 13: ## --- Figure 1 about here ---\n\nFigure 1 shows the heterogeneity of the value of OSS across the top programming languages. Panel A shows the supply side value with the labor value being displayed on the vertical axis. We find that OSS packages created in Go have the highest value with $803 million in value that would have to be created from scratch if the OSS packages did not exist. Go is closely followed by JavaScript  and  Java  with  $758  million  and  $658  million,  respectively.  The  value  of  C  and Typescript is $406 million and $317 million, respectively, while Python has the lowest value of the top languages with around $55 million. JavaScript is not only the top language on GitHub since at least 2014 (GitHub, 2022) it is also the language with one of the highest values in our data. In contrast, Python became more popular over time moving up from the number four spot to the number two language being used in 2020 across all OSS packages on GitHub, while it is in the last spot of our top languages.\n\nPanel B shows the demand side value across the top programming languages. Based on usage generated value, Go is more than four times the value of the next language, JavaScript.\n\nTypescript (a language that extends JavaScript) has seen immense growth rising from the tenth spot of the top 10 languages in 2017 to the fourth spot in 2020 which is also reflected in our data with  Typescript  being  the  third  most  important  language  on  the  demand  side.  The  two  web languages are followed by C and far behind are Java, and Python.\n\nDocument 16: ## 5.

Our research lays the groundwork for future studies of not only OSS, but of all IT and its growing impact on the global economy.\n\nDocument 12: ## --- Table 1 about here ---\n\nTable  1  shows  descriptive  statistics  from  both  data  sets  separately.  The  inward-facing Census  (Panel  A)  contains  just  over  261.7  million  lines  of  code  with  72%  of  the  lines  being attributable to the top programming languages. The average package includes 142 thousand lines of code with a slightly lower average of 113 thousand lines of code for the subset of top languages. When considering the demand (usage) side, we observe that the Census packages were used over 2.7 million times while 92% of this usage is attributable to the top languages. The average package was used 1,472.4 times with a higher usage of around 1,497.5 for the top  languages.  For  the outward-facing  BuiltWith  data  we  find  similar  patterns,  but  at  different  levels.  The  packages included from BuiltWith include over 82 million lines of code, 71% of which are attributable to the  top  programming  languages.  The  average  package  within  the  BuiltWith  sample  has  111 thousand  lines  of  code  with  a  lower  average  of  around  80  thousand  lines  of  code  for  the  top languages. This is because our BuiltWith data primarily consists of JavaScript-based packages, which are often smaller than packages written in other languages. BuiltWith packages were used over 142 thousand times where 99.97% were attributable to the top languages. Next, we used these raw observations to calculate the value of all OSS through the labor market approach and estimated the value created from the supply and demand side.\n\n--- Table 2 about here ---\n\nTable 2 shows the estimates for the value of OSS based on the firm-relevant joint Census and BuiltWith sample. All estimates in Table 2 are based only on software languages classified in bucket  1  from  Table  A1,  which  are  the  most  likely  to  be  written  by  a  human  rather  than  a machine. 19 The first column contains estimates with wages from a low income country (India), the global  average  wage,  and  a  high  income  country  (United  States  of  America),  respectively  (as described above). To reproduce all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the idea of OSS still exists, but all current OSS is deleted and needs to be coded from scratch), using programmers at the average developer wage from India, it would require an investment of $1.22 billion. In contrast, if we use the average developer wage from the United States, then reproducing all widely-used OSS would require  an  investment  of  $6.22  billion.  Using  a  pool  of  programmers  from  across  the  world, weighed based on the existing geographic contributions to OSS as discussed above, would lead to an investment somewhere in between the low and high-income country, $4.15 billion. It is useful to compare these numbers to those from similar studies to understand differences in valuing all OSS (prior studies) versus that which is widely used (our study). Robbins et al. (2021) and Blind et al. (2021) use a method similar to ours and estimate that the value of OSS created in the US is $38 billion in 2019 and that created in the EU is €1 billion in 2018. Wachs et al. (2022) show that roughly 50% of OSS contributions come from the US and EU combined. In aggregate, that would lead these studies to give a global value of OSS of $78 billion. Thus, our middle estimate of a supply-side value of $4.15 billion for only firm-oriented and widely used OSS is a credible lowerbound and highlights the higher estimations of the total of supply-side value of OSS when not considering whether or not a given OSS package is widely used. This further indicates that the supply-side value of the most widely used OSS is roughly 5.5% of the supply-side value of all OSS.\n\nThe second column in Table 2 contains the demand side estimates based on the labor market approach. We find that if firms had to recreate all OSS packages they used (e.g., OSS itself no longer existed and every firm that used an OSS package had to recreate it), then the entire cost would amount to between $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion using labor from the low wage or high wage country only, respectively. A pool of programmers across the globe could recreate all of OSS that is being widely used for a cost of approximately $8.80 trillion. Interpreting this number is\n\n19 Tables in the appendix show the equivalent values from Table 2 when including software language buckets 1 and 2 (Table A3) and all three software language buckets (Table A4).\n\nslightly more complicated but still feasible. According to a Statista (2023) report, global software revenue in 2020 (the same year as our data) was $531.7 billion. However, this represents a flow, not a stock, of software. Relying on government estimates that software fully depreciates over three years, we can do a back of the envelope calculation and consider the purchase value of the full stock of prepackaged software used in 2020 as the aggregate of that sold from 2018 to 2020, which is $1.54 trillion. Further, this represents only the expenditure on prepackaged software and does  not  include  custom  purchased  or  in-house  developed  software.  Here,  the  best  obtainable estimates of private-sector investment in software overall come from the United States National Income and Product Accounts data (NIPA 2023). In 2020, the national account data shows that in the  US,  private  firms  spent  $479.2  billion  on  software,  of  which  45%  ($215.5  billion)  was prepackaged. If we assume this is a consistent ratio for the rest of the world, then the total amount firms spent on software being used in 2020 was $3.4 trillion (= $1.54 trillion\/0.45). Combining this rough estimate with the demand side estimate of the value of OSS based on an average global wage ($8.8 trillion), this indicates firms would spend $12.2 trillion (=$3.4 trillion + $8.8 trillion), or three and a half times what they currently spend if they needed to pay in-house developers to write the OSS that they currently use for free.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"distracting element","seed_document_id":14,"distracting_context":"## -- Figure 4 about here ---\n\nFigure 3 shows the Lorenz curves and the number of repositories that a fraction of programmers has contributed to for the supply side (Panel A) and the demand side (Panel B).

Instead, Panel A shows a Lorenz curve as a nearly flat line with a drastic increase for the final share of programmers.

We further create bounds by using a low-wage (India) and high-wage (USA) labor market for the wage to better understand how the value would vary by the pool of programmers used to recreate all of OSS. 18\n\nDocument 8: ## 3. Methodology\n\nWe first measure the value of OSS by considering the supply and the demand side of OSS using a labor market approach. 14 The thought experiment is that we live in a world where OSS does not exist and has to be recreated at each firm that uses a given piece of OSS. Using the labor market approach, we calculate the labor replacement cost of each OSS package. To estimate the value for each package, we use COCOMO II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) at the individual package level and then sum across all package values to obtain a supply-side labor market replacement value. Then, we scale the supply-side value by the number of times firms are using each package while removing multi-usage within each firm to obtain a demand-side value.\n\nSecond, we move beyond the aggregate and inspect inequality in the value creation process. In OSS, as with many creative endeavors, it is common that a small handful of individuals provide the bulk of the contributions, while many others make small contributions (sometimes referred to as the 80\/20 rule, implying 80% of the work is done by 20% of the people). Research has shown these frequent contributors often attain positions of influence in OSS communities as a result of their efforts (Hanisch, et al, 2018). Therefore, to better understand the dispersion of value creation across developers, we first use the GHTorrent data and identify individual developer contributions in two ways: a) through their OSS value contributions directly and b) through the total number of repositories they contributed to. We then test how concentrated these two contribution measures are to better understand whether many or few developers contribute to the total value we measure. We explain the exact details for the labor market approach and the inequality of valuations below.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"distracting element","seed_document_id":11,"distracting_context":"## Appendix A) Goods-Market Valuation Approach\n\nAs an alternate estimation method, instead of using the labor replacement cost, we use a goods replacement value approach. We identify several OSS packages that have similar closed-source, pecuniary alternatives and consider the costs if all commercial users of the free OSS had to replace that software with a pecuniary alternative (similar to the calculations Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) performed for web servers). We can then use this alternate value of p , combined with the q values from above to estimate a goods replacement value of OSS. This method builds on suggestions from Nordhaus (2006, p. 146) who says '…the price of market and nonmarket goods and services should be imputed on the basis of the comparable market goods and services.' We do not expect the estimates from the two methods to be similar. Quite the contrary, the value of those two methods varies substantially since the latter goods-market approach assumes a fixed price to sell a good multiple times and that fixed price is usually lower than the total value estimated from recreating all packages on the labor side. The differential between these estimates is  essentially the result of a firm stepping in to reproduce the missing OSS packages and then selling them for a pecuniary price rather than all firms needing to reproduce those packages from scratch themselves.\n\nWith the goods market approach, the thought experiment is still that we live in a world where OSS does not exist, but it has to be recreated via one firm that then charges a price for a good that is currently free. To value OSS via the goods market approach, we created a basket of equivalent substitute proprietary goods that are priced on the open market as a stand-in for an OSS product.  This  methodology  is  consistent  with  that  used  in  the  prior  literature  (Greenstein  and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021) although both of those studies only used a single good rather than a basket since they were focused on only one type of OSS (web servers). Since there is no readily available database for proprietary equivalents of OSS, we conduct a search based on subjective  perception  of  popularity  of  OSS  and  we  then  search  for  pecuniary,  closed-source substitutes for them. The resulting basket of 20 OSS packages with proprietary substitutes is a good representation of the diversity of OSS. The software ranges from media and design software to statistical analysis programs, to database management and web server software. 21\n\n21 Table A5 shows the basket of OSS and their proprietary equivalents that we used. To create this basket, we looked for proprietary software that had an OSS equivalent that was similar in its overall function and feature set, and sought to identify pairs of software that, in aggregate, captured a broad and representative set of the types of OSS that exist.\n\nBased on our OSS equivalent substitute proprietary goods basket we then obtain prices for each proprietary software equivalent and we calculated the COCOMO labor market supply-side value for each OSS product in the basket which we use as a proxy - for lack of the code from the proprietary software - for the COCOMO labor supply side value of the proprietary software (e.g., the cost it would take to pay a programmer to write that proprietary software from scratch). We then calculate the average COCOMO labor supply-side value of the basket, 𝑉 !,1#23.4 ,  and  the average price for the basket, 𝑃 !,1#23.4 . 22 Since, we know the labor market supply-side value of all OSS, 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; , we can setup the following equation and obtain the price of OSS, 𝑃 ! for the goodsmarket for all OSS via a simple scaling transformation:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nThis results in the following goods-market supply-side value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nWe can then obtain the equivalent demand-side goods-market values as follows:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nFrom the goods market side, we consider the equivalent price that a firm would charge if it produced all existing widely used OSS and then sold it as a product to customers.\n\nTable A6, column 3 shows that the value on the demand side ranges between $177 million and $244 million across the different buckets independent of the country of origin from which programmers are hired. Naturally, the goods-market value will be substantially smaller than the labor demand value since this imaginary firm will make a profit at a comparatively low price by producing the software once and then selling it to many customers. Further, while Greenstein and Nagle (2014) as well as Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) focus on one particular type of software only (web servers), we attempt to expand on their approach to many goods. However, the data limitations become a stronger constraint in this context which makes it inherently more difficult\n\n22 We obtained the average price of the goods-market proprietary basket by using a 3 years lifespan of software, i.e. 1\/(1-0.66), so the depreciation factor is 0.33. This is consistent with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules for depreciating software, which states 'If you can depreciate the cost of computer software, use the straight line method over a useful life of 36 months.' https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/publications\/p946#en\\_US\\_2022\\_publink1000107354.\n\nto  estimate  the  value  through  this  approach  while  requiring  substantially  more  assumptions. Instead of a pure goods-market approach, this requires assistance from the labor-market approach in terms of scaling for the estimate, which ultimately leads to a substantial underestimate of the value of OSS. Further, the pricing strategy of the proprietary software counterparts is sensitive to the  market  demand.  With  the  goods-market  approach  extending  to  multiple  goods,  the  strong implicit assumption is that the market demands for our basket software and our sample OSS are similar, so they lead to commensurate prices.\n\nAn alternative and even more simplified goods-market back-of-the-envelope calculation that does not account for lines of code and relies on no scaling from the labor market approach would simply be to multiply a price of a reference good with the usage. We can take the minimum, average, and maximum prices of the basket of proprietary goods as captured in the reference price vector p = (69.99, 1610.17, 5800) and simply multiply it with usage from the combined Census and BuiltWith sample (Table 1). Based on those imputed proprietary price assumptions, the goods market demand side value would range from $0.2 - $16.5 trillion (minimum price - maximum price)  with  the  mean  price  resulting  in  a  value  estimate  of  $4.5  trillion.  However,  while  this estimate creates slightly more variance than the labor market approach, it is inherently flawed by simply assuming that the imputed prices are identical for each open source product based on the reference price. We further think this very simple back-of-the-envelope is an orange to apples comparison since the goods in our basket are fully functional, stand-alone software packages, while the packages in the Census and BuiltWith datasets are comprised of application libraries, which are generally smaller than such stand-alone packages.\n\nGiven all the complexities and assumptions one has to make due to lack of data for a goodsmarket approach, we place stronger emphasis on the labor cost approach highlighted in the main body but we include this method here for completeness.","topic":"Others"}}

Conclusion\n\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith. We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average value and distributed it across industries.\n\nIn this study we estimate the value of widely-used open source software globally with two unique datasets: the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data. We are able to estimate not only the supply side value of existing code (e.g., the cost it would take to rewrite each piece of widely-used OSS once) but also the demand side value for the private economy (e.g., the cost it would take for each company that uses a piece of OSS to rewrite it). While we do not focus on the long tail of OSS, we consider this an additional contribution of our study as focusing on OSS that is widely used allows us to more precisely understand the value created by OSS, rather than only measuring the  replacement  cost  for  all  OSS  (which  would  overestimate  the  true  value  since  many  OSS projects are not used in production code). However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n\nAdjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.  We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves.  Over  95%  percent  of  the  demand-side  value  is  generated  by  only  five  percent  of programmers, and those programmers contribute not only to a few widely used projects but to substantially more projects than the programmers that are engaged at the lower end of the value distribution.\n\nIn aggregate, our results show the substantial value that OSS contributes to the economy despite this value generally showing up as zero via direct measurement since prices equal zero and quantity is difficult to measure using public data alone. Our research lays the groundwork for future studies of not only OSS, but of all IT and its growing impact on the global economy.\n\nDocument 14: ## --- Figure 2 about here ---\n\nFigure 2 splits the OSS value estimates for each language by our inward facing (Census) and outward facing (BuiltWith) data sources. Panel A and Panel B focus on the supply and demand side estimation for the Census. We obtain a similar pattern that has been established already in the aggregate when pooling both data sources (Figure 1) albeit the impact of JavaScript is substantially lower.  On  the  supply  side  of  the  Census  in  Panel  A,  Java  has  the  second-highest  value  while JavaScript  code  from  the  Census  contributes  to  a  substantially  lower  value  to  the  aggregate. Similarly, the supply side values of C, Python, and Typescript are mainly driven by the Census. From the demand side Panel B we find that Go is the most popular language for inward facing code while all other languages appear to be negligible in relative terms.\n\nFigure 2, Panel C and Panel D show the supply and demand side values for the BuiltWith dataset. The supply side value in Panel C clearly indicates that the value from the BuiltWith sample is driven by JavaScript code, which is a good sanity check since we focused on JavaScript packages to proxy for OSS in the BuiltWith sample, as discussed above. The second highest value is created by TypeScript which is reassuring since it is a superset of JavaScript. Panel D shows a similar pattern  on  the  usage  side  where  most  of  the  value  arises  from  JavaScript  while  TypeScript  is trailing at the second spot as well. The other languages contribute only marginal amounts to the supply and demand side values. Overall, these findings are broadly consistent with the main use cases of the various languages (web programming vs. application programming) and an idea that languages through which value are generated are not necessarily identical to languages that are used by the general public.\n\n--- Figure 3 about here ---\n\nFigure 3 shows the demand-side value of OSS across industries by NAICS 2-digit codes using the BuiltWith online data. 20 This can be interpreted as the value each of these industries receive because OSS exists. The industry with the highest usage value of around $43 billion is 'Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.' 'Retail Trade' as well as 'Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services' make up another large part of the demand-side externally facing value of OSS with $36 billion and $35 billion, respectively. In contrast, industries that constitute just a small portion of the value are 'Mining, Quarrying, and Oil  and  Gas  Extraction',  'Utilities',  'Agriculture,  Forestry,  Fishing,  and  Hunting.'  The  latter industries are classical non-service sector industries and as such software is expected to play less of a role there.\n\nDocument 12: ## --- Table 1 about here ---\n\nTable  1  shows  descriptive  statistics  from  both  data  sets  separately.  The  inward-facing Census  (Panel  A)  contains  just  over  261.7  million  lines  of  code  with  72%  of  the  lines  being attributable to the top programming languages. The average package includes 142 thousand lines of code with a slightly lower average of 113 thousand lines of code for the subset of top languages. When considering the demand (usage) side, we observe that the Census packages were used over 2.7 million times while 92% of this usage is attributable to the top languages. The average package was used 1,472.4 times with a higher usage of around 1,497.5 for the top  languages.  For  the outward-facing  BuiltWith  data  we  find  similar  patterns,  but  at  different  levels.  The  packages included from BuiltWith include over 82 million lines of code, 71% of which are attributable to the  top  programming  languages.  The  average  package  within  the  BuiltWith  sample  has  111 thousand  lines  of  code  with  a  lower  average  of  around  80  thousand  lines  of  code  for  the  top languages. This is because our BuiltWith data primarily consists of JavaScript-based packages, which are often smaller than packages written in other languages. BuiltWith packages were used over 142 thousand times where 99.97% were attributable to the top languages. Next, we used these raw observations to calculate the value of all OSS through the labor market approach and estimated the value created from the supply and demand side.\n\n--- Table 2 about here ---\n\nTable 2 shows the estimates for the value of OSS based on the firm-relevant joint Census and BuiltWith sample. All estimates in Table 2 are based only on software languages classified in bucket  1  from  Table  A1,  which  are  the  most  likely  to  be  written  by  a  human  rather  than  a machine. 19 The first column contains estimates with wages from a low income country (India), the global  average  wage,  and  a  high  income  country  (United  States  of  America),  respectively  (as described above). To reproduce all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the idea of OSS still exists, but all current OSS is deleted and needs to be coded from scratch), using programmers at the average developer wage from India, it would require an investment of $1.22 billion. In contrast, if we use the average developer wage from the United States, then reproducing all widely-used OSS would require  an  investment  of  $6.22  billion.  Using  a  pool  of  programmers  from  across  the  world, weighed based on the existing geographic contributions to OSS as discussed above, would lead to an investment somewhere in between the low and high-income country, $4.15 billion. It is useful to compare these numbers to those from similar studies to understand differences in valuing all OSS (prior studies) versus that which is widely used (our study). Robbins et al. (2021) and Blind et al. (2021) use a method similar to ours and estimate that the value of OSS created in the US is $38 billion in 2019 and that created in the EU is €1 billion in 2018. Wachs et al. (2022) show that roughly 50% of OSS contributions come from the US and EU combined. In aggregate, that would lead these studies to give a global value of OSS of $78 billion. Thus, our middle estimate of a supply-side value of $4.15 billion for only firm-oriented and widely used OSS is a credible lowerbound and highlights the higher estimations of the total of supply-side value of OSS when not considering whether or not a given OSS package is widely used. This further indicates that the supply-side value of the most widely used OSS is roughly 5.5% of the supply-side value of all OSS.\n\nThe second column in Table 2 contains the demand side estimates based on the labor market approach. We find that if firms had to recreate all OSS packages they used (e.g., OSS itself no longer existed and every firm that used an OSS package had to recreate it), then the entire cost would amount to between $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion using labor from the low wage or high wage country only, respectively. A pool of programmers across the globe could recreate all of OSS that is being widely used for a cost of approximately $8.80 trillion. Interpreting this number is\n\n19 Tables in the appendix show the equivalent values from Table 2 when including software language buckets 1 and 2 (Table A3) and all three software language buckets (Table A4).\n\nslightly more complicated but still feasible. According to a Statista (2023) report, global software revenue in 2020 (the same year as our data) was $531.7 billion. However, this represents a flow, not a stock, of software. Relying on government estimates that software fully depreciates over three years, we can do a back of the envelope calculation and consider the purchase value of the full stock of prepackaged software used in 2020 as the aggregate of that sold from 2018 to 2020, which is $1.54 trillion. Further, this represents only the expenditure on prepackaged software and does  not  include  custom  purchased  or  in-house  developed  software.  Here,  the  best  obtainable estimates of private-sector investment in software overall come from the United States National Income and Product Accounts data (NIPA 2023). In 2020, the national account data shows that in the  US,  private  firms  spent  $479.2  billion  on  software,  of  which  45%  ($215.5  billion)  was prepackaged. If we assume this is a consistent ratio for the rest of the world, then the total amount firms spent on software being used in 2020 was $3.4 trillion (= $1.54 trillion\/0.45). Combining this rough estimate with the demand side estimate of the value of OSS based on an average global wage ($8.8 trillion), this indicates firms would spend $12.2 trillion (=$3.4 trillion + $8.8 trillion), or three and a half times what they currently spend if they needed to pay in-house developers to write the OSS that they currently use for free.\n\nDocument 6: ## 1. Introduction\n\nIn 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that 'software is eating the world' (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that 'open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,' (Jacks, 2022). Other recent studies have come to similar conclusions showing that open source software  (OSS)  -  software  whose  source  code  is  publicly  available  for  inspection,  use,  and modification and is often created in a decentralized manner and distributed for free - appears in 96% of codebases (Synopsys 2023), and that some commercial software consists of up to 99.9% freely available OSS (Musseau et al., 2022). Although in its early days OSS frequently copied features from existing proprietary software, OSS today includes cutting edge technology in various fields including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, big data, and analytics.  However, despite the increasing importance of OSS to all software (and therefore to the entire economy), measuring its impact has been elusive. Traditionally, to measure the value created by a good or service,  economists  multiply  the  price  ( p )  times  the  quantity  sold  ( q ).  However,  in  OSS, p is generally zero since the source code is publicly available, and q is  unknown due to the limited number of restrictions around how the code may be copied and reused. For example, if a company downloads  a  piece  of  OSS  from  a  public  code  repository,  it  may  copy  it  thousands  of  times internally (legally) and then share it with suppliers or customers (also legally), so public download data is insufficient. Although some recent studies have sought to estimate the value of p (discussed below), data for estimating q has been unavailable or intractable for anything more than just a handful of OSS packages. Using newly collected data from multiple sources, the goal of this paper is to provide estimates for both p and q and to use those to shine light on the question: What is the value of open source software?\n\nUnderstanding the value of OSS is of critical importance not only due to the role it plays in the economy, but also due to it being one of the most successful and impactful modern examples of the centuries old economic concept of 'the commons' which run the risk of meeting the fate known as 'the tragedy of the commons.' This concept can trace its roots as far back as the 4 th -century BC philosopher Aristotle who wrote 'That which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care. Men pay most attention to what is their own and care less for what is common.'  (Aristotle,  1981).  William  Forster  Lloyd  (1833)  resurfaced  the  idea  in  modern economic thought by highlighting the example of shared tracts of land used for cattle grazing by\n\nmultiple cattle herders who each had an incentive to overuse the shared resource. Garrett Hardin (1968)  brought  the  concept  into  the  broader  zeitgeist  when  he  wrote  an  article  discussing  the problem entitled 'The Tragedy of the Commons.' Building on this work, Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for her research highlighting paths to avoiding the tragedy of the commons through community coordination efforts that did not necessitate government enforced laws to manage and guard the commons (Ostrom 1990). The parallels between shared grazing lands and shared digital infrastructure are palpable - the availability of communal grass to feed cattle, and in turn feed people, was critical to the agrarian economy, and the ability to not have to recreate code that someone else has already written is critical to the modern economy. Further, in both contexts, despite knowing grass and code are critical inputs to the economy, measuring their actual value is difficult. And, as the renowned mathematician and physicist Lord Kelvin is believed to have said, 'If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.' And if you cannot improve and maintain it, such common goods may crumble under the weight of their own success as they are overused, but underinvested in (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021). Therefore, measuring the value OSS creates is crucial to the future health of the digital economy, and the rest of the economy that is built on top of it.\n\nImportantly, recent studies have attempted to address these measurement issues but fall short of capturing both the breadth and depth of OSS usage - a gap we seek to fill with this paper. For example, researchers have attempted to gain breadth by using novel methodologies to estimate the labor replacement value of the current corpus of OSS created in the United States at $38 billion in 2019 (Robbins et al., 2021) and that created in the European Union at €1 billion (Blind et al., 2021) by imputing the labor costs that it would have taken to rewrite existing OSS. Such efforts do a very good job at estimating what it would cost to replace all existing OSS if it disappeared tomorrow. However, the resultant estimates rely on two important assumptions. First, that all OSS is equally valuable from a usage standpoint, and second that the concept of OSS would still exist, and society would just need to rewrite the code once, thus addressing the aforementioned problem of a missing value for p , but not addressing the missing value of q . In a world where OSS did not exist at all, then each piece of OSS software would not need to be rewritten just once, but instead would need to be rewritten by every firm that used the software (assuming the firm could freely share the software within its boundaries). Other research (Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; MurcianoGoroff, Zhuo, and Greenstein, 2021) has gone deeper into this hypothetical, albeit in a narrow\n\nmanner, by only focusing on web servers (which are public facing on the Internet and can therefore be readily measured). Using different methods, both studies measure q for this one type of software and impute p by using a goods replacement value approach based on the prices for closed-source alternatives offered by firms. With data from the United States the resulting estimates show a value of  $2  billion  for  the  OSS  Apache  Web  Server  in  2012  (Greenstein  and  Nagle,  2014)  and  a combined value of $4.5 billion for Apache and the increasingly popular OSS web server nginx in 2018 (Murciano-Goroff, et al., 2021). However, although web servers are an important part of the OSS  ecosystem,  they  constitute  a  small  portion  of  it.  We  seek  to  build  upon  the  important contributions this existing research has made in an attempt to go both broad and deep to create a more complete measure of the value of OSS.\n\nTo consider the value of OSS in both a broad and deep manner, we use data from two primary sources that allow us to gain insights into the OSS used at tens of thousands of firms across the world. The first is the 'Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries' (Nagle et al., 2022). The Census II project utilized partnerships with multiple software composition analysis (SCA) firms to create various lists of the most widely used OSS. SCAs are hired to scan the codebases of a company to ensure they are not violating any OSS licenses and, as a byproduct, track all the OSS code used by their customers and the products they build. The Census II project aggregated data from multiple SCAs to build a dataset of OSS usage at tens of thousands of firms based  on  millions  of  data  points  (observations  of  OSS  usage).  The  second  data  source  is  the BuiltWith dataset, from which we leverage scans of nearly nine million websites to identify the underlying technology deployed by these websites, including OSS libraries. The BuiltWith data has been used in multiple academic studies (DeStefano &amp; Timmis 2023, Dushnitsky &amp; Stroube 2021, Koning et al.. 2022), but to our knowledge this is the first one to focus on OSS usage. The Census II data and the BuiltWith data are complementary as the former focuses on OSS that is built  into  the  software  a  company  sells,  while  the  latter  focuses  on  OSS  that  is  built  into  a company's website, thus reducing the chances of double-counting observations across the datasets. In aggregate, these two datasets combined create the most complete measurement of OSS usage ( q ) to date. Further, by focusing on OSS that is widely deployed and used by firms, rather than considering all the projects that exist in an OSS repository, we enhance the methodologies of prior studies by reducing the likelihood of measurement error stemming from projects that are posted as publicly available OSS but are not actually used in any practical manner. Not accounting for this\n\nmeasurement error would lead to overestimation of the actual value of OSS as projects that are widely used would be valued in the same way as projects that are not used at all.\n\nTo estimate p ,  we  follow  the  literature  discussed  above  and  use  the  labor  replacement value. First, we calculate the labor cost it would take an individual firm to recreate a given OSS package by measuring the number of lines of code within the package and then applying the Constructive Cost Model II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) - also known as COCOMO II to estimate the number of person-hours it would take to write the code from scratch. We then utilize global wage data from Salary Expert to get an accurate estimate of the labor costs a firm would incur if this piece of OSS did not exist. These costs can be combined with the q values from above at the OSS package level to estimate the combined value of all OSS from both the supply and demand sides.\n\nWe find a value ranging from $1.22 billion to $6.22 billion if we were to decide as a society to recreate all widely used OSS on the supply side. However, considering the actual usage of OSS leads to a demand-side value that is orders of magnitude larger and ranges from $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion, if each firm who used an OSS package had to recreate it from scratch (e.g., the concept of OSS did not exist). We document substantial heterogeneity of the value of OSS by programming  language  and  internal  vs  outward-facing  programming  efforts.  Further,  we  find considerable  heterogeneity  in  value  contributions  by  programmers  as  5%  of  programmers  are responsible for more than 90% of the value created on the supply- and demand- side. The data we use is arguably the most comprehensive source of data to measure the value created by firm usage of OSS at this time. However, as for any project, the evidence is not complete and we argue that we underestimate the value since our data, e.g., does not include operating systems, which are a substantial omitted category of OSS.\n\nThis study makes four important contributions to the academic literature, practitioners, and policy makers. First, it provides the most complete estimate of the value of widely used OSS to date  by  accounting  for  not  only  the  supply-side  of  OSS  (price  to  create  it),  but  also  for  the usage\/demand-side at a scale that has not been done before. While prior estimates of the value of OSS only went either broad (estimating the supply-side costs of a large swath of OSS) or deep (estimating the value created by one particular type of OSS), this study does both by using unique datasets that allow for a better understanding of the breadth and depth of OSS usage. Further, rather than measuring the value of all OSS, this study focuses on the value of OSS that is used by firms\n\nto create its products and websites, limiting the measurement error occurring in studies that are unable to account for which OSS is actually used in production. This contribution builds upon, and extends, important research (e.g., Blind et al., 2021; Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021; Robbins et al., 2021) that has sought to identify the value of this vital resource that contributes a great deal to the modern economy despite the difficulties measuring this contribution. In  doing  so,  it  adds  insights  to  a  long-running  discussion  related  to  the  impact  of  information technology (IT) on productivity (Brynjolfsson, 1993; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 1996; Nagle, 2019a; Solow, 1987) known as the 'productivity paradox' where IT investments can have limited impact on productivity statistics. This debate has continued into the emerging context of AI (Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson, 2018). Our work contributes to this conversation by highlighting a massive societal level cost-savings (and hence productivity enhancement) that is created by the existence of OSS.\n\nSecond, our research contributes methodological advances to the study of intangible capital by highlighting novel sources of data related to investments in OSS. Prior research has shown that intangible capital plays an increasingly important role in economic growth (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel,  2009)  and  firm  value  (Peters  and  Taylor,  2017),  but  it  often  goes  unmeasured  or misattributed (Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou, 2014). Further, we demonstrate how these data sources can be used to understand the true investments in software that a firm makes, and that which they would have to make if OSS did not exist.  This  is  valuable  as  investments  in  software  are  an increasingly important type of intangible capital that is driving innovation (Branstetter, Drev, and Kwon, 2019) and performance (Krishnan et al., 2000).\n\nThird, our results help highlight for firms and managers the importance of OSS to their production, and ideally add weight to arguments that users of OSS should not just free ride but also contribute to the creation and maintenance of OSS (e.g., Henkel, 2008; Nagle, 2018). Such contributions are a fraction of the costs that firms would incur if OSS did not exist and the active participation of OSS users in helping maintain the OSS they use is critical to the health and future well-being of the OSS ecosystem (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021; Zhang et al., 2019).\n\nFourth,  and  finally,  our  study  helps  inform  policymakers  who  have  recently  started  to understand  the  growing  importance  of  OSS  to  the  economy  and  taken  actions  to  support  the ecosystem (European Commission, 2020; Executive Order No. 14028, 2021). However, most of these efforts are related to securing the existing OSS ecosystem, which is quite important, but do\n\nnot go as far as supporting the creation of new OSS. Our results help shine light on the importance of OSS to the overall economy and add weight to calls for more societal support of this critical resource. Our results further show that the majority of the value created by OSS is created by a small  number  of  contributors.  Although  it  has  long  been  known  that  a  small  number  of  OSS contributors do most of the work, we add new insights that show this is even more true for the value creation of widely-used OSS projects and that societal support for these individuals is critical to the future success of OSS, and in turn, the economy.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

A  pervasive example is open source software (OSS), a global public good that plays a vital role in the economy and is foundational for most technology we use today. However, it is difficult to measure the value of OSS due to its non-pecuniary nature and lack of centralized usage tracking. Therefore, OSS remains largely unaccounted for in economic measures. Although prior studies have estimated the supply-side costs to recreate this software, a lack of data has hampered estimating the much larger demand-side (usage) value created by OSS. Therefore, to understand the complete economic and social value of widely-used OSS, we leverage unique global data from two complementary sources capturing  OSS  usage  by  millions  of  global  firms.  We  first  estimate  the  supply-side  value  by calculating the cost to recreate the most widely used OSS once. We then calculate the demandside value based on a replacement value for each firm that uses the software and would need to build it internally if OSS did not exist. We estimate the supply-side value of widely-used OSS is $4.15 billion, but that the demand-side value is much larger at $8.8 trillion. We find that firms would need to spend 3.5 times more on software than they currently do if OSS did not exist. The top six programming languages in our sample comprise 84% of the demand-side value of OSS. Further, 96% of the demand-side value is created by only 5% of OSS developers.\n\nJEL Classification:\n\nH4; O3; J0\n\nKeywords: Open-source software, global public good\n\nAcknowledgement: The authors are grateful for  financial  and  administrative  support  from  the Linux  Foundation  without  which  the  data  from  the  Census  would  not  have  otherwise  been available.

We ask how much it would cost to reproduce the package by hiring a programmer and paying them a competitive market wage. To estimate this supply-side value ( 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; ) , we take the complete list of OSS packages discussed above, and then count the lines of code in each unique\n\n14 In an alternative version, we use a mixture of a labor and goods market approach that is more closely aligned with Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff, et al (2021). However, applying this method in our setting requires numerous additional assumptions due to data constraints. For simplicity we call it the goods market approach for which we provide the details and statistics, as well as the limitations in Appendix A.\n\npackage. 15 For each unique package,  , we calculate the value and then sum over all these values i to obtain the total value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nIn this calculation, we implicitly do not incorporate any production externalities since we assume that there is no spillover knowledge from one package to the next that would lower the cost of programming. 16 This methodology is similar to that used by other papers that estimate the supply-side costs of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021).\n\nWe then calculate the demand-side value of OSS by incorporating the usage information ( Q) for each package:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nHere, we do not incorporate consumption externalities, i.e., we do not allow a benefit to arise for the general public when a package has been created and we further make sure that each firm is only replacing a package they use once, since a replaced package can be used within a firm as a club good (e.g., see Cornes and Sandler, 1996). The value 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost to rewrite all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the concept of OSS still exists, but all of these packages needed to be rewritten from scratch), while the value 𝑉 + \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost for each firm that uses one of these OSS packages to pay a developer to rewrite those packages (e.g., OSS itself no longer exists).\n\nFor both the supply and demand models, we obtain the dollar-value for each package ( 𝑃 ( ) via the Constructive Cost Model II, also abbreviated as COCOMO II (Boehm 1984, Boehm et al. 2009). The model has previously been used by the United States Department of Defense to estimate software project costs as well as in prior research estimating the value of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021). It is a highly flexible model that allows us to create non-linear transformations of lines of code to dollar-values. It uses the following modelling equation:\n\n15 We use only the pure lines of code excluding documentation lines and empty lines. Hence, we underestimate the true value of recreating each package.\n\n16 Similar to a representative agent model (e.g. see Williamson 2006), one may think of each package being reproduced by separate programmers who are identical replicas of each other (and therefore have the same skill level, but do not become more efficient via learning).\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n( (\n\nwhere 𝐿 represents the lines of codes in thousands and E the effort in person-month units for each project  . Consistent with Blind et al. (2021), we use the default parameter values for i 𝛼 , 𝛽 and 𝜂. The parameters 𝛼 𝛽 , are non-linear adjustment factors set to 2.94, and 1.0997 respectively . The parameter 𝜂 is an effort-adjustment factor which can be modified to incorporate subjective assessments of product, hardware, personnel, and project attributes. Since we do not have a prior for each project, we set 𝜂 to the default value of one. To obtain the price ( 𝑃 ( ) of each OSS project, we  then  multiply  the  results  of  equation  (3)  by  the  weighted  global  wage  that  an  average programmer would obtain on the open market. To calculate a global wage, we include the base monthly salaries of software developers from Salary Expert for the top 30 countries in terms of their GitHub developer counts in 2021 (Wachs et al., 2022). 17 The weight of each country is its share of active GitHub contributors over the total contributors in the top 30 countries. We further create bounds by using a low-wage (India) and high-wage (USA) labor market for the wage to better understand how the value would vary by the pool of programmers used to recreate all of OSS. 18\n\nDocument 8: ## 3. Methodology\n\nWe first measure the value of OSS by considering the supply and the demand side of OSS using a labor market approach. 14 The thought experiment is that we live in a world where OSS does not exist and has to be recreated at each firm that uses a given piece of OSS. Using the labor market approach, we calculate the labor replacement cost of each OSS package. To estimate the value for each package, we use COCOMO II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) at the individual package level and then sum across all package values to obtain a supply-side labor market replacement value. Then, we scale the supply-side value by the number of times firms are using each package while removing multi-usage within each firm to obtain a demand-side value.\n\nSecond, we move beyond the aggregate and inspect inequality in the value creation process. In OSS, as with many creative endeavors, it is common that a small handful of individuals provide the bulk of the contributions, while many others make small contributions (sometimes referred to as the 80\/20 rule, implying 80% of the work is done by 20% of the people). Research has shown these frequent contributors often attain positions of influence in OSS communities as a result of their efforts (Hanisch, et al, 2018). Therefore, to better understand the dispersion of value creation across developers, we first use the GHTorrent data and identify individual developer contributions in two ways: a) through their OSS value contributions directly and b) through the total number of repositories they contributed to. We then test how concentrated these two contribution measures are to better understand whether many or few developers contribute to the total value we measure. We explain the exact details for the labor market approach and the inequality of valuations below.\n\nDocument 21: ## Appendix A) Goods-Market Valuation Approach\n\nAs an alternate estimation method, instead of using the labor replacement cost, we use a goods replacement value approach. We identify several OSS packages that have similar closed-source, pecuniary alternatives and consider the costs if all commercial users of the free OSS had to replace that software with a pecuniary alternative (similar to the calculations Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) performed for web servers). We can then use this alternate value of p , combined with the q values from above to estimate a goods replacement value of OSS. This method builds on suggestions from Nordhaus (2006, p. 146) who says '…the price of market and nonmarket goods and services should be imputed on the basis of the comparable market goods and services.' We do not expect the estimates from the two methods to be similar. Quite the contrary, the value of those two methods varies substantially since the latter goods-market approach assumes a fixed price to sell a good multiple times and that fixed price is usually lower than the total value estimated from recreating all packages on the labor side. The differential between these estimates is  essentially the result of a firm stepping in to reproduce the missing OSS packages and then selling them for a pecuniary price rather than all firms needing to reproduce those packages from scratch themselves.\n\nWith the goods market approach, the thought experiment is still that we live in a world where OSS does not exist, but it has to be recreated via one firm that then charges a price for a good that is currently free. To value OSS via the goods market approach, we created a basket of equivalent substitute proprietary goods that are priced on the open market as a stand-in for an OSS product.  This  methodology  is  consistent  with  that  used  in  the  prior  literature  (Greenstein  and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021) although both of those studies only used a single good rather than a basket since they were focused on only one type of OSS (web servers). Since there is no readily available database for proprietary equivalents of OSS, we conduct a search based on subjective  perception  of  popularity  of  OSS  and  we  then  search  for  pecuniary,  closed-source substitutes for them. The resulting basket of 20 OSS packages with proprietary substitutes is a good representation of the diversity of OSS. The software ranges from media and design software to statistical analysis programs, to database management and web server software. 21\n\n21 Table A5 shows the basket of OSS and their proprietary equivalents that we used. To create this basket, we looked for proprietary software that had an OSS equivalent that was similar in its overall function and feature set, and sought to identify pairs of software that, in aggregate, captured a broad and representative set of the types of OSS that exist.\n\nBased on our OSS equivalent substitute proprietary goods basket we then obtain prices for each proprietary software equivalent and we calculated the COCOMO labor market supply-side value for each OSS product in the basket which we use as a proxy - for lack of the code from the proprietary software - for the COCOMO labor supply side value of the proprietary software (e.g., the cost it would take to pay a programmer to write that proprietary software from scratch). We then calculate the average COCOMO labor supply-side value of the basket, 𝑉 !,1#23.4 ,  and  the average price for the basket, 𝑃 !,1#23.4 . 22 Since, we know the labor market supply-side value of all OSS, 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; , we can setup the following equation and obtain the price of OSS, 𝑃 ! for the goodsmarket for all OSS via a simple scaling transformation:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nThis results in the following goods-market supply-side value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nWe can then obtain the equivalent demand-side goods-market values as follows:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nFrom the goods market side, we consider the equivalent price that a firm would charge if it produced all existing widely used OSS and then sold it as a product to customers.\n\nTable A6, column 3 shows that the value on the demand side ranges between $177 million and $244 million across the different buckets independent of the country of origin from which programmers are hired. Naturally, the goods-market value will be substantially smaller than the labor demand value since this imaginary firm will make a profit at a comparatively low price by producing the software once and then selling it to many customers. Further, while Greenstein and Nagle (2014) as well as Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) focus on one particular type of software only (web servers), we attempt to expand on their approach to many goods. However, the data limitations become a stronger constraint in this context which makes it inherently more difficult\n\n22 We obtained the average price of the goods-market proprietary basket by using a 3 years lifespan of software, i.e. 1\/(1-0.66), so the depreciation factor is 0.33. This is consistent with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules for depreciating software, which states 'If you can depreciate the cost of computer software, use the straight line method over a useful life of 36 months.' https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/publications\/p946#en\\_US\\_2022\\_publink1000107354.\n\nto  estimate  the  value  through  this  approach  while  requiring  substantially  more  assumptions. Instead of a pure goods-market approach, this requires assistance from the labor-market approach in terms of scaling for the estimate, which ultimately leads to a substantial underestimate of the value of OSS. Further, the pricing strategy of the proprietary software counterparts is sensitive to the  market  demand.  With  the  goods-market  approach  extending  to  multiple  goods,  the  strong implicit assumption is that the market demands for our basket software and our sample OSS are similar, so they lead to commensurate prices.\n\nAn alternative and even more simplified goods-market back-of-the-envelope calculation that does not account for lines of code and relies on no scaling from the labor market approach would simply be to multiply a price of a reference good with the usage. We can take the minimum, average, and maximum prices of the basket of proprietary goods as captured in the reference price vector p = (69.99, 1610.17, 5800) and simply multiply it with usage from the combined Census and BuiltWith sample (Table 1). Based on those imputed proprietary price assumptions, the goods market demand side value would range from $0.2 - $16.5 trillion (minimum price - maximum price)  with  the  mean  price  resulting  in  a  value  estimate  of  $4.5  trillion.  However,  while  this estimate creates slightly more variance than the labor market approach, it is inherently flawed by simply assuming that the imputed prices are identical for each open source product based on the reference price. We further think this very simple back-of-the-envelope is an orange to apples comparison since the goods in our basket are fully functional, stand-alone software packages, while the packages in the Census and BuiltWith datasets are comprised of application libraries, which are generally smaller than such stand-alone packages.\n\nGiven all the complexities and assumptions one has to make due to lack of data for a goodsmarket approach, we place stronger emphasis on the labor cost approach highlighted in the main body but we include this method here for completeness.\n\nDocument 11: ## 4. Results\n\nAfter applying the labor market approach using COCOMO II, we obtain global estimates for the value of OSS. To calculate the overall value, we first need the underlying number of lines of code (to calculate the supply-side value) and then the usage statistics (for the demand-side value). Since there may be substantial heterogeneity in value by programming languages, we also show the top programming languages during our investigation period in the year 2020, as discussed above.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"distracting element","seed_document_id":9,"distracting_context":"Working Paper 24-038","topic":"Others"}}

Introduction\n\nIn 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that 'software is eating the world' (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that 'open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,' (Jacks, 2022). Other recent studies have come to similar conclusions showing that open source software  (OSS)  -  software  whose  source  code  is  publicly  available  for  inspection,  use,  and modification and is often created in a decentralized manner and distributed for free - appears in 96% of codebases (Synopsys 2023), and that some commercial software consists of up to 99.9% freely available OSS (Musseau et al., 2022). Although in its early days OSS frequently copied features from existing proprietary software, OSS today includes cutting edge technology in various fields including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, big data, and analytics.  However, despite the increasing importance of OSS to all software (and therefore to the entire economy), measuring its impact has been elusive. Traditionally, to measure the value created by a good or service,  economists  multiply  the  price  ( p )  times  the  quantity  sold  ( q ).  However,  in  OSS, p is generally zero since the source code is publicly available, and q is  unknown due to the limited number of restrictions around how the code may be copied and reused. For example, if a company downloads  a  piece  of  OSS  from  a  public  code  repository,  it  may  copy  it  thousands  of  times internally (legally) and then share it with suppliers or customers (also legally), so public download data is insufficient. Although some recent studies have sought to estimate the value of p (discussed below), data for estimating q has been unavailable or intractable for anything more than just a handful of OSS packages. Using newly collected data from multiple sources, the goal of this paper is to provide estimates for both p and q and to use those to shine light on the question: What is the value of open source software?\n\nUnderstanding the value of OSS is of critical importance not only due to the role it plays in the economy, but also due to it being one of the most successful and impactful modern examples of the centuries old economic concept of 'the commons' which run the risk of meeting the fate known as 'the tragedy of the commons.' This concept can trace its roots as far back as the 4 th -century BC philosopher Aristotle who wrote 'That which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care. Men pay most attention to what is their own and care less for what is common.'  (Aristotle,  1981).  William  Forster  Lloyd  (1833)  resurfaced  the  idea  in  modern economic thought by highlighting the example of shared tracts of land used for cattle grazing by\n\nmultiple cattle herders who each had an incentive to overuse the shared resource. Garrett Hardin (1968)  brought  the  concept  into  the  broader  zeitgeist  when  he  wrote  an  article  discussing  the problem entitled 'The Tragedy of the Commons.' Building on this work, Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for her research highlighting paths to avoiding the tragedy of the commons through community coordination efforts that did not necessitate government enforced laws to manage and guard the commons (Ostrom 1990). The parallels between shared grazing lands and shared digital infrastructure are palpable - the availability of communal grass to feed cattle, and in turn feed people, was critical to the agrarian economy, and the ability to not have to recreate code that someone else has already written is critical to the modern economy. Further, in both contexts, despite knowing grass and code are critical inputs to the economy, measuring their actual value is difficult. And, as the renowned mathematician and physicist Lord Kelvin is believed to have said, 'If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.' And if you cannot improve and maintain it, such common goods may crumble under the weight of their own success as they are overused, but underinvested in (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021). Therefore, measuring the value OSS creates is crucial to the future health of the digital economy, and the rest of the economy that is built on top of it.\n\nImportantly, recent studies have attempted to address these measurement issues but fall short of capturing both the breadth and depth of OSS usage - a gap we seek to fill with this paper. For example, researchers have attempted to gain breadth by using novel methodologies to estimate the labor replacement value of the current corpus of OSS created in the United States at $38 billion in 2019 (Robbins et al., 2021) and that created in the European Union at €1 billion (Blind et al., 2021) by imputing the labor costs that it would have taken to rewrite existing OSS. Such efforts do a very good job at estimating what it would cost to replace all existing OSS if it disappeared tomorrow. However, the resultant estimates rely on two important assumptions. First, that all OSS is equally valuable from a usage standpoint, and second that the concept of OSS would still exist, and society would just need to rewrite the code once, thus addressing the aforementioned problem of a missing value for p , but not addressing the missing value of q . In a world where OSS did not exist at all, then each piece of OSS software would not need to be rewritten just once, but instead would need to be rewritten by every firm that used the software (assuming the firm could freely share the software within its boundaries). Other research (Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; MurcianoGoroff, Zhuo, and Greenstein, 2021) has gone deeper into this hypothetical, albeit in a narrow\n\nmanner, by only focusing on web servers (which are public facing on the Internet and can therefore be readily measured). Using different methods, both studies measure q for this one type of software and impute p by using a goods replacement value approach based on the prices for closed-source alternatives offered by firms. With data from the United States the resulting estimates show a value of  $2  billion  for  the  OSS  Apache  Web  Server  in  2012  (Greenstein  and  Nagle,  2014)  and  a combined value of $4.5 billion for Apache and the increasingly popular OSS web server nginx in 2018 (Murciano-Goroff, et al., 2021). However, although web servers are an important part of the OSS  ecosystem,  they  constitute  a  small  portion  of  it.  We  seek  to  build  upon  the  important contributions this existing research has made in an attempt to go both broad and deep to create a more complete measure of the value of OSS.\n\nTo consider the value of OSS in both a broad and deep manner, we use data from two primary sources that allow us to gain insights into the OSS used at tens of thousands of firms across the world. The first is the 'Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries' (Nagle et al., 2022). The Census II project utilized partnerships with multiple software composition analysis (SCA) firms to create various lists of the most widely used OSS. SCAs are hired to scan the codebases of a company to ensure they are not violating any OSS licenses and, as a byproduct, track all the OSS code used by their customers and the products they build. The Census II project aggregated data from multiple SCAs to build a dataset of OSS usage at tens of thousands of firms based  on  millions  of  data  points  (observations  of  OSS  usage).  The  second  data  source  is  the BuiltWith dataset, from which we leverage scans of nearly nine million websites to identify the underlying technology deployed by these websites, including OSS libraries. The BuiltWith data has been used in multiple academic studies (DeStefano &amp; Timmis 2023, Dushnitsky &amp; Stroube 2021, Koning et al.. 2022), but to our knowledge this is the first one to focus on OSS usage. The Census II data and the BuiltWith data are complementary as the former focuses on OSS that is built  into  the  software  a  company  sells,  while  the  latter  focuses  on  OSS  that  is  built  into  a company's website, thus reducing the chances of double-counting observations across the datasets. In aggregate, these two datasets combined create the most complete measurement of OSS usage ( q ) to date. Further, by focusing on OSS that is widely deployed and used by firms, rather than considering all the projects that exist in an OSS repository, we enhance the methodologies of prior studies by reducing the likelihood of measurement error stemming from projects that are posted as publicly available OSS but are not actually used in any practical manner. Not accounting for this\n\nmeasurement error would lead to overestimation of the actual value of OSS as projects that are widely used would be valued in the same way as projects that are not used at all.\n\nTo estimate p ,  we  follow  the  literature  discussed  above  and  use  the  labor  replacement value. First, we calculate the labor cost it would take an individual firm to recreate a given OSS package by measuring the number of lines of code within the package and then applying the Constructive Cost Model II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) - also known as COCOMO II to estimate the number of person-hours it would take to write the code from scratch. We then utilize global wage data from Salary Expert to get an accurate estimate of the labor costs a firm would incur if this piece of OSS did not exist. These costs can be combined with the q values from above at the OSS package level to estimate the combined value of all OSS from both the supply and demand sides.\n\nWe find a value ranging from $1.22 billion to $6.22 billion if we were to decide as a society to recreate all widely used OSS on the supply side. However, considering the actual usage of OSS leads to a demand-side value that is orders of magnitude larger and ranges from $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion, if each firm who used an OSS package had to recreate it from scratch (e.g., the concept of OSS did not exist). We document substantial heterogeneity of the value of OSS by programming  language  and  internal  vs  outward-facing  programming  efforts.  Further,  we  find considerable  heterogeneity  in  value  contributions  by  programmers  as  5%  of  programmers  are responsible for more than 90% of the value created on the supply- and demand- side. The data we use is arguably the most comprehensive source of data to measure the value created by firm usage of OSS at this time. However, as for any project, the evidence is not complete and we argue that we underestimate the value since our data, e.g., does not include operating systems, which are a substantial omitted category of OSS.\n\nThis study makes four important contributions to the academic literature, practitioners, and policy makers. First, it provides the most complete estimate of the value of widely used OSS to date  by  accounting  for  not  only  the  supply-side  of  OSS  (price  to  create  it),  but  also  for  the usage\/demand-side at a scale that has not been done before. While prior estimates of the value of OSS only went either broad (estimating the supply-side costs of a large swath of OSS) or deep (estimating the value created by one particular type of OSS), this study does both by using unique datasets that allow for a better understanding of the breadth and depth of OSS usage. Further, rather than measuring the value of all OSS, this study focuses on the value of OSS that is used by firms\n\nto create its products and websites, limiting the measurement error occurring in studies that are unable to account for which OSS is actually used in production. This contribution builds upon, and extends, important research (e.g., Blind et al., 2021; Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021; Robbins et al., 2021) that has sought to identify the value of this vital resource that contributes a great deal to the modern economy despite the difficulties measuring this contribution. In  doing  so,  it  adds  insights  to  a  long-running  discussion  related  to  the  impact  of  information technology (IT) on productivity (Brynjolfsson, 1993; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 1996; Nagle, 2019a; Solow, 1987) known as the 'productivity paradox' where IT investments can have limited impact on productivity statistics. This debate has continued into the emerging context of AI (Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson, 2018). Our work contributes to this conversation by highlighting a massive societal level cost-savings (and hence productivity enhancement) that is created by the existence of OSS.\n\nSecond, our research contributes methodological advances to the study of intangible capital by highlighting novel sources of data related to investments in OSS. Prior research has shown that intangible capital plays an increasingly important role in economic growth (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel,  2009)  and  firm  value  (Peters  and  Taylor,  2017),  but  it  often  goes  unmeasured  or misattributed (Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou, 2014). Further, we demonstrate how these data sources can be used to understand the true investments in software that a firm makes, and that which they would have to make if OSS did not exist.  This  is  valuable  as  investments  in  software  are  an increasingly important type of intangible capital that is driving innovation (Branstetter, Drev, and Kwon, 2019) and performance (Krishnan et al., 2000).\n\nThird, our results help highlight for firms and managers the importance of OSS to their production, and ideally add weight to arguments that users of OSS should not just free ride but also contribute to the creation and maintenance of OSS (e.g., Henkel, 2008; Nagle, 2018). Such contributions are a fraction of the costs that firms would incur if OSS did not exist and the active participation of OSS users in helping maintain the OSS they use is critical to the health and future well-being of the OSS ecosystem (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021; Zhang et al., 2019).\n\nFourth,  and  finally,  our  study  helps  inform  policymakers  who  have  recently  started  to understand  the  growing  importance  of  OSS  to  the  economy  and  taken  actions  to  support  the ecosystem (European Commission, 2020; Executive Order No. 14028, 2021). However, most of these efforts are related to securing the existing OSS ecosystem, which is quite important, but do\n\nnot go as far as supporting the creation of new OSS. Our results help shine light on the importance of OSS to the overall economy and add weight to calls for more societal support of this critical resource. Our results further show that the majority of the value created by OSS is created by a small  number  of  contributors.  Although  it  has  long  been  known  that  a  small  number  of  OSS contributors do most of the work, we add new insights that show this is even more true for the value creation of widely-used OSS projects and that societal support for these individuals is critical to the future success of OSS, and in turn, the economy.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the empirical setting and data. Section 3 discusses the methods including measurement challenges. In section 4, we estimate the value of open source software. Section 5 concludes.\n\nDocument 16: ## 5. Conclusion\n\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith. We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average value and distributed it across industries.\n\nIn this study we estimate the value of widely-used open source software globally with two unique datasets: the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data. We are able to estimate not only the supply side value of existing code (e.g., the cost it would take to rewrite each piece of widely-used OSS once) but also the demand side value for the private economy (e.g., the cost it would take for each company that uses a piece of OSS to rewrite it). While we do not focus on the long tail of OSS, we consider this an additional contribution of our study as focusing on OSS that is widely used allows us to more precisely understand the value created by OSS, rather than only measuring the  replacement  cost  for  all  OSS  (which  would  overestimate  the  true  value  since  many  OSS projects are not used in production code). However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n\nAdjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website.

We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves.

The  inward-facing Census  (Panel  A)  contains  just  over  261.7  million  lines  of  code  with  72%  of  the  lines  being attributable to the top programming languages. The average package includes 142 thousand lines of code with a slightly lower average of 113 thousand lines of code for the subset of top languages. When considering the demand (usage) side, we observe that the Census packages were used over 2.7 million times while 92% of this usage is attributable to the top languages. The average package was used 1,472.4 times with a higher usage of around 1,497.5 for the top  languages.  For  the outward-facing  BuiltWith  data  we  find  similar  patterns,  but  at  different  levels.  The  packages included from BuiltWith include over 82 million lines of code, 71% of which are attributable to the  top  programming  languages.  The  average  package  within  the  BuiltWith  sample  has  111 thousand  lines  of  code  with  a  lower  average  of  around  80  thousand  lines  of  code  for  the  top languages. This is because our BuiltWith data primarily consists of JavaScript-based packages, which are often smaller than packages written in other languages. BuiltWith packages were used over 142 thousand times where 99.97% were attributable to the top languages. Next, we used these raw observations to calculate the value of all OSS through the labor market approach and estimated the value created from the supply and demand side.\n\n--- Table 2 about here ---\n\nTable 2 shows the estimates for the value of OSS based on the firm-relevant joint Census and BuiltWith sample. All estimates in Table 2 are based only on software languages classified in bucket  1  from  Table  A1,  which  are  the  most  likely  to  be  written  by  a  human  rather  than  a machine. 19 The first column contains estimates with wages from a low income country (India), the global  average  wage,  and  a  high  income  country  (United  States  of  America),  respectively  (as described above). To reproduce all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the idea of OSS still exists, but all current OSS is deleted and needs to be coded from scratch), using programmers at the average developer wage from India, it would require an investment of $1.22 billion. In contrast, if we use the average developer wage from the United States, then reproducing all widely-used OSS would require  an  investment  of  $6.22  billion.  Using  a  pool  of  programmers  from  across  the  world, weighed based on the existing geographic contributions to OSS as discussed above, would lead to an investment somewhere in between the low and high-income country, $4.15 billion. It is useful to compare these numbers to those from similar studies to understand differences in valuing all OSS (prior studies) versus that which is widely used (our study). Robbins et al. (2021) and Blind et al. (2021) use a method similar to ours and estimate that the value of OSS created in the US is $38 billion in 2019 and that created in the EU is €1 billion in 2018. Wachs et al. (2022) show that roughly 50% of OSS contributions come from the US and EU combined. In aggregate, that would lead these studies to give a global value of OSS of $78 billion. Thus, our middle estimate of a supply-side value of $4.15 billion for only firm-oriented and widely used OSS is a credible lowerbound and highlights the higher estimations of the total of supply-side value of OSS when not considering whether or not a given OSS package is widely used. This further indicates that the supply-side value of the most widely used OSS is roughly 5.5% of the supply-side value of all OSS.\n\nThe second column in Table 2 contains the demand side estimates based on the labor market approach. We find that if firms had to recreate all OSS packages they used (e.g., OSS itself no longer existed and every firm that used an OSS package had to recreate it), then the entire cost would amount to between $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion using labor from the low wage or high wage country only, respectively. A pool of programmers across the globe could recreate all of OSS that is being widely used for a cost of approximately $8.80 trillion. Interpreting this number is\n\n19 Tables in the appendix show the equivalent values from Table 2 when including software language buckets 1 and 2 (Table A3) and all three software language buckets (Table A4).\n\nslightly more complicated but still feasible. According to a Statista (2023) report, global software revenue in 2020 (the same year as our data) was $531.7 billion. However, this represents a flow, not a stock, of software. Relying on government estimates that software fully depreciates over three years, we can do a back of the envelope calculation and consider the purchase value of the full stock of prepackaged software used in 2020 as the aggregate of that sold from 2018 to 2020, which is $1.54 trillion. Further, this represents only the expenditure on prepackaged software and does  not  include  custom  purchased  or  in-house  developed  software.  Here,  the  best  obtainable estimates of private-sector investment in software overall come from the United States National Income and Product Accounts data (NIPA 2023). In 2020, the national account data shows that in the  US,  private  firms  spent  $479.2  billion  on  software,  of  which  45%  ($215.5  billion)  was prepackaged. If we assume this is a consistent ratio for the rest of the world, then the total amount firms spent on software being used in 2020 was $3.4 trillion (= $1.54 trillion\/0.45). Combining this rough estimate with the demand side estimate of the value of OSS based on an average global wage ($8.8 trillion), this indicates firms would spend $12.2 trillion (=$3.4 trillion + $8.8 trillion), or three and a half times what they currently spend if they needed to pay in-house developers to write the OSS that they currently use for free.","topic":"Others"}}

Introduction\n\nIn 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that 'software is eating the world' (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that 'open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,' (Jacks, 2022). Other recent studies have come to similar conclusions showing that open source software  (OSS)  -  software  whose  source  code  is  publicly  available  for  inspection,  use,  and modification and is often created in a decentralized manner and distributed for free - appears in 96% of codebases (Synopsys 2023), and that some commercial software consists of up to 99.9% freely available OSS (Musseau et al., 2022). Although in its early days OSS frequently copied features from existing proprietary software, OSS today includes cutting edge technology in various fields including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, big data, and analytics.  However, despite the increasing importance of OSS to all software (and therefore to the entire economy), measuring its impact has been elusive. Traditionally, to measure the value created by a good or service,  economists  multiply  the  price  ( p )  times  the  quantity  sold  ( q ).  However,  in  OSS, p is generally zero since the source code is publicly available, and q is  unknown due to the limited number of restrictions around how the code may be copied and reused. For example, if a company downloads  a  piece  of  OSS  from  a  public  code  repository,  it  may  copy  it  thousands  of  times internally (legally) and then share it with suppliers or customers (also legally), so public download data is insufficient. Although some recent studies have sought to estimate the value of p (discussed below), data for estimating q has been unavailable or intractable for anything more than just a handful of OSS packages. Using newly collected data from multiple sources, the goal of this paper is to provide estimates for both p and q and to use those to shine light on the question: What is the value of open source software?\n\nUnderstanding the value of OSS is of critical importance not only due to the role it plays in the economy, but also due to it being one of the most successful and impactful modern examples of the centuries old economic concept of 'the commons' which run the risk of meeting the fate known as 'the tragedy of the commons.' This concept can trace its roots as far back as the 4 th -century BC philosopher Aristotle who wrote 'That which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care. Men pay most attention to what is their own and care less for what is common.'  (Aristotle,  1981).  William  Forster  Lloyd  (1833)  resurfaced  the  idea  in  modern economic thought by highlighting the example of shared tracts of land used for cattle grazing by\n\nmultiple cattle herders who each had an incentive to overuse the shared resource. Garrett Hardin (1968)  brought  the  concept  into  the  broader  zeitgeist  when  he  wrote  an  article  discussing  the problem entitled 'The Tragedy of the Commons.' Building on this work, Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for her research highlighting paths to avoiding the tragedy of the commons through community coordination efforts that did not necessitate government enforced laws to manage and guard the commons (Ostrom 1990). The parallels between shared grazing lands and shared digital infrastructure are palpable - the availability of communal grass to feed cattle, and in turn feed people, was critical to the agrarian economy, and the ability to not have to recreate code that someone else has already written is critical to the modern economy. Further, in both contexts, despite knowing grass and code are critical inputs to the economy, measuring their actual value is difficult. And, as the renowned mathematician and physicist Lord Kelvin is believed to have said, 'If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.' And if you cannot improve and maintain it, such common goods may crumble under the weight of their own success as they are overused, but underinvested in (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021). Therefore, measuring the value OSS creates is crucial to the future health of the digital economy, and the rest of the economy that is built on top of it.\n\nImportantly, recent studies have attempted to address these measurement issues but fall short of capturing both the breadth and depth of OSS usage - a gap we seek to fill with this paper. For example, researchers have attempted to gain breadth by using novel methodologies to estimate the labor replacement value of the current corpus of OSS created in the United States at $38 billion in 2019 (Robbins et al., 2021) and that created in the European Union at €1 billion (Blind et al., 2021) by imputing the labor costs that it would have taken to rewrite existing OSS. Such efforts do a very good job at estimating what it would cost to replace all existing OSS if it disappeared tomorrow. However, the resultant estimates rely on two important assumptions. First, that all OSS is equally valuable from a usage standpoint, and second that the concept of OSS would still exist, and society would just need to rewrite the code once, thus addressing the aforementioned problem of a missing value for p , but not addressing the missing value of q . In a world where OSS did not exist at all, then each piece of OSS software would not need to be rewritten just once, but instead would need to be rewritten by every firm that used the software (assuming the firm could freely share the software within its boundaries). Other research (Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; MurcianoGoroff, Zhuo, and Greenstein, 2021) has gone deeper into this hypothetical, albeit in a narrow\n\nmanner, by only focusing on web servers (which are public facing on the Internet and can therefore be readily measured). Using different methods, both studies measure q for this one type of software and impute p by using a goods replacement value approach based on the prices for closed-source alternatives offered by firms. With data from the United States the resulting estimates show a value of  $2  billion  for  the  OSS  Apache  Web  Server  in  2012  (Greenstein  and  Nagle,  2014)  and  a combined value of $4.5 billion for Apache and the increasingly popular OSS web server nginx in 2018 (Murciano-Goroff, et al., 2021). However, although web servers are an important part of the OSS  ecosystem,  they  constitute  a  small  portion  of  it.  We  seek  to  build  upon  the  important contributions this existing research has made in an attempt to go both broad and deep to create a more complete measure of the value of OSS.\n\nTo consider the value of OSS in both a broad and deep manner, we use data from two primary sources that allow us to gain insights into the OSS used at tens of thousands of firms across the world. The first is the 'Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries' (Nagle et al., 2022). The Census II project utilized partnerships with multiple software composition analysis (SCA) firms to create various lists of the most widely used OSS. SCAs are hired to scan the codebases of a company to ensure they are not violating any OSS licenses and, as a byproduct, track all the OSS code used by their customers and the products they build. The Census II project aggregated data from multiple SCAs to build a dataset of OSS usage at tens of thousands of firms based  on  millions  of  data  points  (observations  of  OSS  usage).  The  second  data  source  is  the BuiltWith dataset, from which we leverage scans of nearly nine million websites to identify the underlying technology deployed by these websites, including OSS libraries. The BuiltWith data has been used in multiple academic studies (DeStefano &amp; Timmis 2023, Dushnitsky &amp; Stroube 2021, Koning et al.. 2022), but to our knowledge this is the first one to focus on OSS usage. The Census II data and the BuiltWith data are complementary as the former focuses on OSS that is built  into  the  software  a  company  sells,  while  the  latter  focuses  on  OSS  that  is  built  into  a company's website, thus reducing the chances of double-counting observations across the datasets. In aggregate, these two datasets combined create the most complete measurement of OSS usage ( q ) to date. Further, by focusing on OSS that is widely deployed and used by firms, rather than considering all the projects that exist in an OSS repository, we enhance the methodologies of prior studies by reducing the likelihood of measurement error stemming from projects that are posted as publicly available OSS but are not actually used in any practical manner. Not accounting for this\n\nmeasurement error would lead to overestimation of the actual value of OSS as projects that are widely used would be valued in the same way as projects that are not used at all.\n\nTo estimate p ,  we  follow  the  literature  discussed  above  and  use  the  labor  replacement value. First, we calculate the labor cost it would take an individual firm to recreate a given OSS package by measuring the number of lines of code within the package and then applying the Constructive Cost Model II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) - also known as COCOMO II to estimate the number of person-hours it would take to write the code from scratch. We then utilize global wage data from Salary Expert to get an accurate estimate of the labor costs a firm would incur if this piece of OSS did not exist. These costs can be combined with the q values from above at the OSS package level to estimate the combined value of all OSS from both the supply and demand sides.\n\nWe find a value ranging from $1.22 billion to $6.22 billion if we were to decide as a society to recreate all widely used OSS on the supply side. However, considering the actual usage of OSS leads to a demand-side value that is orders of magnitude larger and ranges from $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion, if each firm who used an OSS package had to recreate it from scratch (e.g., the concept of OSS did not exist). We document substantial heterogeneity of the value of OSS by programming  language  and  internal  vs  outward-facing  programming  efforts.  Further,  we  find considerable  heterogeneity  in  value  contributions  by  programmers  as  5%  of  programmers  are responsible for more than 90% of the value created on the supply- and demand- side. The data we use is arguably the most comprehensive source of data to measure the value created by firm usage of OSS at this time. However, as for any project, the evidence is not complete and we argue that we underestimate the value since our data, e.g., does not include operating systems, which are a substantial omitted category of OSS.\n\nThis study makes four important contributions to the academic literature, practitioners, and policy makers. First, it provides the most complete estimate of the value of widely used OSS to date  by  accounting  for  not  only  the  supply-side  of  OSS  (price  to  create  it),  but  also  for  the usage\/demand-side at a scale that has not been done before. While prior estimates of the value of OSS only went either broad (estimating the supply-side costs of a large swath of OSS) or deep (estimating the value created by one particular type of OSS), this study does both by using unique datasets that allow for a better understanding of the breadth and depth of OSS usage. Further, rather than measuring the value of all OSS, this study focuses on the value of OSS that is used by firms\n\nto create its products and websites, limiting the measurement error occurring in studies that are unable to account for which OSS is actually used in production. This contribution builds upon, and extends, important research (e.g., Blind et al., 2021; Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021; Robbins et al., 2021) that has sought to identify the value of this vital resource that contributes a great deal to the modern economy despite the difficulties measuring this contribution. In  doing  so,  it  adds  insights  to  a  long-running  discussion  related  to  the  impact  of  information technology (IT) on productivity (Brynjolfsson, 1993; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 1996; Nagle, 2019a; Solow, 1987) known as the 'productivity paradox' where IT investments can have limited impact on productivity statistics. This debate has continued into the emerging context of AI (Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson, 2018). Our work contributes to this conversation by highlighting a massive societal level cost-savings (and hence productivity enhancement) that is created by the existence of OSS.\n\nSecond, our research contributes methodological advances to the study of intangible capital by highlighting novel sources of data related to investments in OSS. Prior research has shown that intangible capital plays an increasingly important role in economic growth (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel,  2009)  and  firm  value  (Peters  and  Taylor,  2017),  but  it  often  goes  unmeasured  or misattributed (Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou, 2014). Further, we demonstrate how these data sources can be used to understand the true investments in software that a firm makes, and that which they would have to make if OSS did not exist.  This  is  valuable  as  investments  in  software  are  an increasingly important type of intangible capital that is driving innovation (Branstetter, Drev, and Kwon, 2019) and performance (Krishnan et al., 2000).\n\nThird, our results help highlight for firms and managers the importance of OSS to their production, and ideally add weight to arguments that users of OSS should not just free ride but also contribute to the creation and maintenance of OSS (e.g., Henkel, 2008; Nagle, 2018). Such contributions are a fraction of the costs that firms would incur if OSS did not exist and the active participation of OSS users in helping maintain the OSS they use is critical to the health and future well-being of the OSS ecosystem (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021; Zhang et al., 2019).\n\nFourth,  and  finally,  our  study  helps  inform  policymakers  who  have  recently  started  to understand  the  growing  importance  of  OSS  to  the  economy  and  taken  actions  to  support  the ecosystem (European Commission, 2020; Executive Order No. 14028, 2021). However, most of these efforts are related to securing the existing OSS ecosystem, which is quite important, but do\n\nnot go as far as supporting the creation of new OSS. Our results help shine light on the importance of OSS to the overall economy and add weight to calls for more societal support of this critical resource. Our results further show that the majority of the value created by OSS is created by a small  number  of  contributors.  Although  it  has  long  been  known  that  a  small  number  of  OSS contributors do most of the work, we add new insights that show this is even more true for the value creation of widely-used OSS projects and that societal support for these individuals is critical to the future success of OSS, and in turn, the economy.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the empirical setting and data. Section 3 discusses the methods including measurement challenges. In section 4, we estimate the value of open source software. Section 5 concludes.\n\nDocument 16: ## 5. Conclusion\n\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith. We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average value and distributed it across industries.\n\nIn this study we estimate the value of widely-used open source software globally with two unique datasets: the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data. We are able to estimate not only the supply side value of existing code (e.g., the cost it would take to rewrite each piece of widely-used OSS once) but also the demand side value for the private economy (e.g., the cost it would take for each company that uses a piece of OSS to rewrite it). While we do not focus on the long tail of OSS, we consider this an additional contribution of our study as focusing on OSS that is widely used allows us to more precisely understand the value created by OSS, rather than only measuring the  replacement  cost  for  all  OSS  (which  would  overestimate  the  true  value  since  many  OSS projects are not used in production code). However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n\nAdjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.  We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves.  Over  95%  percent  of  the  demand-side  value  is  generated  by  only  five  percent  of programmers, and those programmers contribute not only to a few widely used projects but to substantially more projects than the programmers that are engaged at the lower end of the value distribution.\n\nIn aggregate, our results show the substantial value that OSS contributes to the economy despite this value generally showing up as zero via direct measurement since prices equal zero and quantity is difficult to measure using public data alone. Our research lays the groundwork for future studies of not only OSS, but of all IT and its growing impact on the global economy.\n\nDocument 5: ## Abstract\n\nThe  value  of  a  non-pecuniary  (free)  product  is  inherently  difficult  to  assess.  A  pervasive example is open source software (OSS), a global public good that plays a vital role in the economy and is foundational for most technology we use today. However, it is difficult to measure the value of OSS due to its non-pecuniary nature and lack of centralized usage tracking. Therefore, OSS remains largely unaccounted for in economic measures. Although prior studies have estimated the supply-side costs to recreate this software, a lack of data has hampered estimating the much larger demand-side (usage) value created by OSS. Therefore, to understand the complete economic and social value of widely-used OSS, we leverage unique global data from two complementary sources capturing  OSS  usage  by  millions  of  global  firms.  We  first  estimate  the  supply-side  value  by calculating the cost to recreate the most widely used OSS once. We then calculate the demandside value based on a replacement value for each firm that uses the software and would need to build it internally if OSS did not exist. We estimate the supply-side value of widely-used OSS is $4.15 billion, but that the demand-side value is much larger at $8.8 trillion. We find that firms would need to spend 3.5 times more on software than they currently do if OSS did not exist. The top six programming languages in our sample comprise 84% of the demand-side value of OSS. Further, 96% of the demand-side value is created by only 5% of OSS developers.\n\nJEL Classification:\n\nH4; O3; J0\n\nKeywords: Open-source software, global public good\n\nAcknowledgement: The authors are grateful for  financial  and  administrative  support  from  the Linux  Foundation  without  which  the  data  from  the  Census  would  not  have  otherwise  been available.

Empirical Setting and Data\n\nAlthough the concept of free and open software has existed since the 1950's, it became more popular in the 1980's due to the efforts of Richard Stallman and his launch of the GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation (Maracke, 2019). However, it was in the 1990's that OSS took off after Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel, a now widely adopted OSS operating system (Tozzi, 2016). Today, OSS is considered a key building block of the digital economy and is widely used by software developers in everything from phones to cars to refrigerators to cutting-edge AI (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021).\n\nWe use two complementary main data sources to estimate the value of OSS. The first is the Census and is inward facing. It allows us to identify OSS code that goes into products that firms create. The second dataset is BuiltWith and is outward facing, allowing us to identify OSS code  that  consumers  directly  interact  with  through  firm  websites.  Since  the  raw  data  in  both datasets only contains package names, version numbers, and package manager names, and does not  contain  any  source  code  related  information,  we  first  obtain  the  publicly  accessible  code repository for each package which includes package-level information including the lines of code and  the  programming  languages  used.  One  may  worry  about  double-counting  for  the  value calculations as a result of using two separate datasets. However, the overlap of both the Census and  the  BuiltWith  sample  is  very  small:  there  are  only  18  packages  found  in  both  datasets. Moreover, it is unlikely that double counting is a concern as the two datasets capture different dimensions of OSS usage: the Census captures packaged software whose usage is inward-facing while BuiltWith captures usage in websites that are outward-facing. Finally, as a supplementary\n\ndataset, we use GHTorrent, a detailed history of OSS-related activity on GitHub, the most popular OSS hosting platform and a commonly used data source for studies of OSS (e.g., Burton et al, 2017; Conti, Peukert, and Roche, 2023; Fackler, Hofmann, and Laurentsyeva, 2023; Kim, 2020; Tang, Wang, &amp; Tong, 2023). This detailed historical data allows us to go deeper into how the value  of  OSS  is  created  by  better  understanding  the  dispersion  of  the  contributions  across individual OSS developers. We describe the details of all three data sources and their preparation for estimation below.\n\nCensus. The  Census  II  of  Free  and  Open  Source  Software  (here:  Census)  was  jointly undertaken by the Linux Foundation and the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (Nagle et  al.,  2022). 1 The  Census  was  created  via  the  aggregation  of  data  from  three  major  software composition analysis (SCA) firms with thousands of clients across the globe. SCAs are hired to scan the codebase of a client and gather the OSS usage embedded in their proprietary software to ensure they are not violating any OSS license agreements.  Frequently this takes place as part of 2 the due diligence process related to mergers and acquisitions. Unlike other OSS demand measures available from public sources such as package download counts and code changes, the way this data was collected ensures that we observe the precise amount and type of internal OSS usage of the firms. In addition, it allows us to trace the dependencies each package relies on, so that we can observe the indirect OSS usage that is commonly hidden and difficult to obtain.  The result is over 3 2.7 million observations of OSS packages being used within products created by the SCA client firms for the calendar year 2020 (January 1 to December 31, 2020). 4\n\nThe Census project standardized package names based on the naming system of libraries.io -  a  widely  used  site  maintained  by  Tidelift  that  organizes  information  about  more  than  eight million open source packages. The Census focused on the top 2,000 packages based on usage\n\n1 The precise methodologies for the data collection and aggregation are detailed in the Census report by Nagle et al (2022).\n\n2 OSS usage licenses vary a great deal and while some licenses are very open and allow the code to be reused in any manner, including within proprietary code that will be made available for sale at a non-zero price, other licenses restrict reuse to only be allowed if the resultant code is released under the same OSS license (known as copyleft). A detailed discussion of OSS licenses can be found in Lerner and Tirole (2005) and Almeida et al (2017).\n\n3 Indirect OSS usage is captured by dependency analysis and is necessary to accurately measure the full breadth of the OSS a firm relies on. For example, if a firm's proprietary code calls OSS package A, but package A, in turn, calls package B, then only looking at the direct calls would miss that package B was a required building block for the firm's proprietary code.\n\n4 The Census defines an OSS package as 'a unit of software that can be installed and managed by a package manager,' and  defines  a  package  manager  as  'software  that  automates  the  process  of  installing  and  otherwise  managing packages' (Nagle et al, 2022).\n\nreported from the three of the most prominent SCA vendors to identify the most widely used OSS rather  than  the  long-tail  of  the  usage  distribution.  This  led  to  packages  with  less  than  five observations  of  usage  being  dropped.  Since  packages  written  in  the  JavaScript  programming language, and usually hosted on the Node Package Manager (NPM), are generally smaller (fewer lines  of  code)  than  packages  in  other  languages  and  therefore  frequently  have  higher  usage numbers (since developers must include many small packages instead of a few large packages), the Census separately selected the top 1,000 NPM packages and the top 1,000 non-NPM hosted packages.\n\nThis final dataset covers 70% of the total usage of OSS observed in the raw data of the census.   For  each  of  these  2,000  OSS  packages  in  the  Census,  we  identified  the  raw  code 5 maintained on GitHub, the most widely used platform for hosting OSS.  We first attempted to 6 obtain the GitHub repository uniform resource locator (URL) for each package from libraries.io. We were able to match 1,657 packages to repositories via this initial method.  For URLs without 7 a  matching  repository,  we  performed  Google  searches  loosely  following  the  method  in  Singh (2020). More specifically, for each unmatched package, we used the Google API to search for the package name and 'GitHub Repository' and treated the first GitHub repository URL in the results as  its  best  matched  GitHub  URL.   This  resulted  in  an  additional  174  packages  matched  to  a 8 repository. Finally, we manually searched for URLs for the remaining 169 packages to identify the relevant repository. This entire process resulted in matching 1,840 out of the 2,000 Census packages to a code repository with the raw source code for the package. The unmatched packages were determined to have been either removed from GitHub or became proprietary (and thus the original source code was no longer available) and hence, the manual search allowed us to drop\n\n5 The packages that made up the remaining 30% of the full Census data in the long-tail usage distribution were not shared in the final report and therefore cannot be included in our analysis.\n\n6 GitHub  is  a  hosting  and  collaboration  platform  that  contributors  can  use  to  coordinate  the  development  and distribution of OSS projects. Founded in 2008, GitHub has become the largest hub for OSS development in the world. In January 2023, GitHub had more than 370 million repositories and over 100 million developers. In addition to personal users, a wide range of private firms actively use the GitHub platform, including Microsoft (which bought GitHub in 2018), Facebook, Google, and numerous other small and large firms.\n\n7 We attempted to access all repository URLs obtained as a sanity check to ensure they are in working condition. For those we could not access on GitHub, we manually found the correct URLs.\n\n8 As a robustness check, we randomly selected 50 package-repository matches derived from the Google Search method and we checked them by hand. All matches were manually confirmed to be correct providing additional support for the automated matching method.\n\nthese 160 unmatched packages (less than 8% of the Census sample of 2,000) with high confidence from our analysis.\n\nBuiltWith. The BuiltWith data contains scans of all public websites across the globe and identifies the technologies they use. Unlike the inward facing Census data which focus on the usage of OSS, the BuiltWith data scan for the use of both proprietary and OSS in firm websites without explicit differentiation. To separate OSS from proprietary software in BuiltWith, we turn to the subset of all open source web development software in the technology category that includes \"JavaScript and its libraries,\" which generates 778 observations corresponding to the NPM OSS category  in  the  Census  data.  There  are  two  reasons  for  this  sampling  choice.  First,  this  given category is constructed by BuiltWith and we use it as a proxy for OSS to separate it from pecuniary software.  Second,  JavaScript,  one  of  the  core  technologies  for  building  websites,  is  the  most popular programming language by usage on GitHub (GitHub, 2022) and thus enables us to capture the most important OSS from the demand side perspective. The scans include 8.8 million unique websites and 72.8 million corresponding observations of OSS usage from January 1 to November 16, 2020. Further, to ensure that we measure the value of OSS usage generated by the private sector,  we  match  the  adopting  domains  of  the  JavaScript-related  OSS  from  BuiltWith  with company websites recorded in Orbis, Compustat, and PitchBook, three commonly used databases of corporate activity that capture registered businesses across the world. Performing this match ensures that OSS used by non-commercial websites (e.g., an individual person's personal website) is excluded in our analysis. This results in a match-rate of 38.6%, which corresponds to around 3.4 million websites of distinct firms.\n\nFor the BuiltWith data, we cannot employ the first method we use for the Census (using libraries.io to help identify the repository URL) since only the technology names associated with the  packages  were  provided  by  BuiltWith,  and  other  information  (e.g.,  package  and  package manager  names)  is  not  included. 9 Hence,  we  start  by  performing  the  Google  Search  method mentioned above which results in a match of 695 packages to repositories. We then manually searched the Github URLs for 83 of the remaining unmatched packages, resulting in an addition of 46 packages. In total, for the BuiltWith data we were able to identify 741 out of 778 package-\n\n9 Since the package and package manager names are missing, a precise match using libraries.io was not feasible. Technology names are product names intended for customers and can be less technical and precise than the package names for internal development purposes. Thus, using technology names in a libraries.io search could cause significant ambiguity.\n\nrepository matches. As with the Census data, the remaining 37 unmatched packages (less than 5%) are dropped from our analysis because they had been deleted from GitHub.\n\nGHTorrent database. To obtain measures of the dispersion of the OSS value creation, we utilize  the  GHTorrent  database,  which  contains  the  entire  activity  history  on  GitHub  using GitHub's Representational State Transfer (REST) application programming interface (API). We leveraged  its  records  of  GitHub  repositories,  developer-level  commits,  and  developer  public profile information to estimate the contribution of each developer. We narrowed the sample for our developer contribution analysis in two steps. First, we winnowed the GitHub repositories and their  commits  from  GHTorrent  based  on  the  repository  URLs  of  our  joint  Census-BuiltWith sample. 10 Second, we focus on human contributions to OSS by removing approximately eight thousand (12%) GitHub contributors that we considered to be robots. 11 The final sample contains around sixty thousand developers and 2.3 million commits.\n\nTo prepare these three datasets for estimation, we first identified the number of lines of code and the programming languages used for each package using the OSS packages pygount (to count  the  number  of  lines  of  code)  and  linguist  (to  identify  programming  languages). 12 We categorize each distinct language into one of three different buckets moving from more likely human-written to more likely machine-written (see Table A1). Bucket 1 contains programming and markup languages (which are most likely to be human-written), bucket 3 contains data (most likely to be machine-written), and bucket 2 contains anything in between, such as config files and batch processing (which are sometimes human-written and sometimes machine-written, but it is difficult to tell based purely on looking at the code). 13 For our primary estimation we only use bucket 1 while providing robustness checks for buckets 2 and 3 in the Appendix, and thus our results represent a lower bound. Finally, for some analyses we dig deeper and show the top 5 programming languages (as classified by GitHub, 2022 for the year 2020; the year our data is from). The top 5 programming languages contain C (including C# and C++), Java, JavaScript,\n\n10 The match rate is over 96%, with the unmatched repositories accounting for only 0.15% of our calculated OSS demand value discussed below.\n\n11 The filtering is based on the 'fake user' classification by GHTorrent, as well as any usernames containing words 'bot' or 'robot', surrounded by special characters. This method is more conservative than other methods of bot detection  like  that  used  in  the  GitHub  Innovation  Graph  (https:\/\/innovationgraph.github.com\/),  which  rely  on  a monthly commit frequency threshold.\n\n12 https:\/\/pypi.org\/project\/pygount\/ and https:\/\/github.com\/github-linguist\/linguist\n\n13 Note that our focus is the cost to recreate OSS code written by humans, not robots. However, directly removing all OSS contributions from robot accounts is infeasible here, because we cannot observe the exact lines of code written by the robot accounts on GitHub.\n\nPython, and Typescript. We also add Go to this list of top languages since it is an increasingly widely used language in OSS.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"distracting element","seed_document_id":6,"distracting_context":"## --- Figure 1 about here ---\n\nFigure 1 shows the heterogeneity of the value of OSS across the top programming languages. Panel A shows the supply side value with the labor value being displayed on the vertical axis. We find that OSS packages created in Go have the highest value with $803 million in value that would have to be created from scratch if the OSS packages did not exist. Go is closely followed by JavaScript  and  Java  with  $758  million  and  $658  million,  respectively.  The  value  of  C  and Typescript is $406 million and $317 million, respectively, while Python has the lowest value of the top languages with around $55 million. JavaScript is not only the top language on GitHub since at least 2014 (GitHub, 2022) it is also the language with one of the highest values in our data. In contrast, Python became more popular over time moving up from the number four spot to the number two language being used in 2020 across all OSS packages on GitHub, while it is in the last spot of our top languages.\n\nPanel B shows the demand side value across the top programming languages. Based on usage generated value, Go is more than four times the value of the next language, JavaScript.\n\nTypescript (a language that extends JavaScript) has seen immense growth rising from the tenth spot of the top 10 languages in 2017 to the fourth spot in 2020 which is also reflected in our data with  Typescript  being  the  third  most  important  language  on  the  demand  side.

In the first step, we measure the value contributions by developers. In a second step, we obtain a measure for the number of repositories developers contribute to. Finally, we provide a graphical representation of both using the commonly known concept of the Lorenz curve to better understand the extent of inequality in contributions. We describe the details below.\n\nValue Contribution. We calculated the supply and demand values of OSS that each developer contributed. At the repository level, we quantified each developer's proportional work contribution by calculating their share of commits to the total number of commits for a repository. This share was subsequently multiplied with the repository's demand and supply values separately to derive\n\n17 There are 179 counties in Wachs et al. (2022), but the top 30 countries consist of over 88% of the global active contributors with each of the rest having less than 0.6% share. The top 30 countries are listed in Table A2.\n\n18 We choose the high- and low-wage reference countries based on a combination of the number of active GitHub developers and the average annual software developer base wage.\n\nthe value-added contribution of that individual contributor to the repository. Finally, we aggregate the value contributions across all repositories for each developer. The individual value contribution from a unique developer Dev , 𝑉 -+.\/ , can be expressed as:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere 𝜎 ( +.\/ is the share of commits the focal developer made in repository  , and i 𝑉 (-is the demand or supply value of the entire repository   specified in Equations (1) and (2), with i 𝑗 ∈ {𝐷, 𝑆} , and N is the number of repositories in our main sample, i.e. Census and BuiltWith combined.\n\nRepository  Contribution. This  is  simply  the  number  of  repositories  a  given  developer contributes to, and it is expressed as follows:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere   is the indicator function equal to 1 when the developer has a non-zero number of commits 𝟙 to  repository i .  This  measure  entails  the  variety  of  OSS  needs  being  addressed  by  individual developers. Jointly with the value contribution measure, they help us understand whether the value that is being generated overall is concentrated within a small number of developers. It may be generally more desirable for the whole OSS ecosystem and its diversity if individual developers participate in many repositories and not just a few.\n\nMeasuring  the  Dispersion  of  Contributions . To  graphically  examine  the  dispersion  of developer contribution values, we utilized Lorenz curves (Lorenz, 1905), with respect to both demand and supply side values. Lorenz curves are a well-established way to represent inequality and, as such, they allow us to better understand how dispersed developer contributions to OSS within the private economy are. Developers are systematically arranged in ascending order based on their contributions to OSS demand and supply, as delineated in Equation (7). Subsequently, these ranks were normalized to a scale ranging from 0 to 100 percentiles, serving as the x-axis values for the Lorenz Curves. The y-axis, on the other hand, presents the corresponding value contributions 𝑉 -+.\/ . The graphical representation in the results section will elucidate the degree of inequality pertaining to the value contributions among developers. To supplement the analysis, we\n\nfurther investigated how dispersed the repository contribution, 𝑁 +.\/ , is by plotting Equation (8). This enables us to ascertain whether any substantial value inequality stems from top contributors predominantly focusing on a narrow subset of exceptionally popular repositories, or alternatively, from their engagement with a broader spectrum of successful repositories.","topic":"Others"}}

A Lorenz curve that  lay  directly  on  the  45  degree  line  would  imply  a  very  even  distribution  of  values  across programmers. Instead, Panel A shows a Lorenz curve as a nearly flat line with a drastic increase for the final share of programmers. This implies that the distribution of the supply value is highly uneven and considerably more concentrated than the 80\/20 standard. Indeed, the last five percent of programmers, or 3,000 programmers, generate over 93% of the supply side value. Similarly, Panel B shows - when accounting for usage - that those last five percent generate over 96% of the demand side value.  In  aggregate,  this  indicates  that  a  very  small  number  of  programmers  are creating the bulk of OSS code that is heavily relied upon by firms to create their own code. In both Panel A and Panel B we can also see a rise in the number of repositories for the last 10-15% of programmers that contribute  to  the  highest  value,  which  implies  that  the  uneven  value  that  is generated by few programmers is not just due to a few highly valuable repositories but by the contributions of this handful of contributors to a substantial number of repositories.","topic":"Others"}}

Panel A and Panel B focus on the supply and demand side estimation for the Census. We obtain a similar pattern that has been established already in the aggregate when pooling both data sources (Figure 1) albeit the impact of JavaScript is substantially lower.  On  the  supply  side  of  the  Census  in  Panel  A,  Java  has  the  second-highest  value  while JavaScript  code  from  the  Census  contributes  to  a  substantially  lower  value  to  the  aggregate. Similarly, the supply side values of C, Python, and Typescript are mainly driven by the Census. From the demand side Panel B we find that Go is the most popular language for inward facing code while all other languages appear to be negligible in relative terms.\n\nFigure 2, Panel C and Panel D show the supply and demand side values for the BuiltWith dataset. The supply side value in Panel C clearly indicates that the value from the BuiltWith sample is driven by JavaScript code, which is a good sanity check since we focused on JavaScript packages to proxy for OSS in the BuiltWith sample, as discussed above. The second highest value is created by TypeScript which is reassuring since it is a superset of JavaScript. Panel D shows a similar pattern  on  the  usage  side  where  most  of  the  value  arises  from  JavaScript  while  TypeScript  is trailing at the second spot as well. The other languages contribute only marginal amounts to the supply and demand side values. Overall, these findings are broadly consistent with the main use cases of the various languages (web programming vs. application programming) and an idea that languages through which value are generated are not necessarily identical to languages that are used by the general public.\n\n--- Figure 3 about here ---\n\nFigure 3 shows the demand-side value of OSS across industries by NAICS 2-digit codes using the BuiltWith online data. 20 This can be interpreted as the value each of these industries receive because OSS exists. The industry with the highest usage value of around $43 billion is 'Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.' 'Retail Trade' as well as 'Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services' make up another large part of the demand-side externally facing value of OSS with $36 billion and $35 billion, respectively. In contrast, industries that constitute just a small portion of the value are 'Mining, Quarrying, and Oil  and  Gas  Extraction',  'Utilities',  'Agriculture,  Forestry,  Fishing,  and  Hunting.'  The  latter industries are classical non-service sector industries and as such software is expected to play less of a role there.","topic":"Others"}}

Empirical Setting and Data\n\nAlthough the concept of free and open software has existed since the 1950's, it became more popular in the 1980's due to the efforts of Richard Stallman and his launch of the GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation (Maracke, 2019). However, it was in the 1990's that OSS took off after Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel, a now widely adopted OSS operating system (Tozzi, 2016). Today, OSS is considered a key building block of the digital economy and is widely used by software developers in everything from phones to cars to refrigerators to cutting-edge AI (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021).\n\nWe use two complementary main data sources to estimate the value of OSS. The first is the Census and is inward facing. It allows us to identify OSS code that goes into products that firms create. The second dataset is BuiltWith and is outward facing, allowing us to identify OSS code  that  consumers  directly  interact  with  through  firm  websites.  Since  the  raw  data  in  both datasets only contains package names, version numbers, and package manager names, and does not  contain  any  source  code  related  information,  we  first  obtain  the  publicly  accessible  code repository for each package which includes package-level information including the lines of code and  the  programming  languages  used.  One  may  worry  about  double-counting  for  the  value calculations as a result of using two separate datasets. However, the overlap of both the Census and  the  BuiltWith  sample  is  very  small:  there  are  only  18  packages  found  in  both  datasets. Moreover, it is unlikely that double counting is a concern as the two datasets capture different dimensions of OSS usage: the Census captures packaged software whose usage is inward-facing while BuiltWith captures usage in websites that are outward-facing. Finally, as a supplementary\n\ndataset, we use GHTorrent, a detailed history of OSS-related activity on GitHub, the most popular OSS hosting platform and a commonly used data source for studies of OSS (e.g., Burton et al, 2017; Conti, Peukert, and Roche, 2023; Fackler, Hofmann, and Laurentsyeva, 2023; Kim, 2020; Tang, Wang, &amp; Tong, 2023). This detailed historical data allows us to go deeper into how the value  of  OSS  is  created  by  better  understanding  the  dispersion  of  the  contributions  across individual OSS developers. We describe the details of all three data sources and their preparation for estimation below.\n\nCensus. The  Census  II  of  Free  and  Open  Source  Software  (here:  Census)  was  jointly undertaken by the Linux Foundation and the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (Nagle et  al.,  2022). 1 The  Census  was  created  via  the  aggregation  of  data  from  three  major  software composition analysis (SCA) firms with thousands of clients across the globe. SCAs are hired to scan the codebase of a client and gather the OSS usage embedded in their proprietary software to ensure they are not violating any OSS license agreements.  Frequently this takes place as part of 2 the due diligence process related to mergers and acquisitions. Unlike other OSS demand measures available from public sources such as package download counts and code changes, the way this data was collected ensures that we observe the precise amount and type of internal OSS usage of the firms. In addition, it allows us to trace the dependencies each package relies on, so that we can observe the indirect OSS usage that is commonly hidden and difficult to obtain.  The result is over 3 2.7 million observations of OSS packages being used within products created by the SCA client firms for the calendar year 2020 (January 1 to December 31, 2020). 4\n\nThe Census project standardized package names based on the naming system of libraries.io -  a  widely  used  site  maintained  by  Tidelift  that  organizes  information  about  more  than  eight million open source packages. The Census focused on the top 2,000 packages based on usage\n\n1 The precise methodologies for the data collection and aggregation are detailed in the Census report by Nagle et al (2022).\n\n2 OSS usage licenses vary a great deal and while some licenses are very open and allow the code to be reused in any manner, including within proprietary code that will be made available for sale at a non-zero price, other licenses restrict reuse to only be allowed if the resultant code is released under the same OSS license (known as copyleft). A detailed discussion of OSS licenses can be found in Lerner and Tirole (2005) and Almeida et al (2017).\n\n3 Indirect OSS usage is captured by dependency analysis and is necessary to accurately measure the full breadth of the OSS a firm relies on. For example, if a firm's proprietary code calls OSS package A, but package A, in turn, calls package B, then only looking at the direct calls would miss that package B was a required building block for the firm's proprietary code.\n\n4 The Census defines an OSS package as 'a unit of software that can be installed and managed by a package manager,' and  defines  a  package  manager  as  'software  that  automates  the  process  of  installing  and  otherwise  managing packages' (Nagle et al, 2022).\n\nreported from the three of the most prominent SCA vendors to identify the most widely used OSS rather  than  the  long-tail  of  the  usage  distribution.  This  led  to  packages  with  less  than  five observations  of  usage  being  dropped.  Since  packages  written  in  the  JavaScript  programming language, and usually hosted on the Node Package Manager (NPM), are generally smaller (fewer lines  of  code)  than  packages  in  other  languages  and  therefore  frequently  have  higher  usage numbers (since developers must include many small packages instead of a few large packages), the Census separately selected the top 1,000 NPM packages and the top 1,000 non-NPM hosted packages.\n\nThis final dataset covers 70% of the total usage of OSS observed in the raw data of the census.   For  each  of  these  2,000  OSS  packages  in  the  Census,  we  identified  the  raw  code 5 maintained on GitHub, the most widely used platform for hosting OSS.  We first attempted to 6 obtain the GitHub repository uniform resource locator (URL) for each package from libraries.io. We were able to match 1,657 packages to repositories via this initial method.  For URLs without 7 a  matching  repository,  we  performed  Google  searches  loosely  following  the  method  in  Singh (2020). More specifically, for each unmatched package, we used the Google API to search for the package name and 'GitHub Repository' and treated the first GitHub repository URL in the results as  its  best  matched  GitHub  URL.   This  resulted  in  an  additional  174  packages  matched  to  a 8 repository. Finally, we manually searched for URLs for the remaining 169 packages to identify the relevant repository. This entire process resulted in matching 1,840 out of the 2,000 Census packages to a code repository with the raw source code for the package. The unmatched packages were determined to have been either removed from GitHub or became proprietary (and thus the original source code was no longer available) and hence, the manual search allowed us to drop\n\n5 The packages that made up the remaining 30% of the full Census data in the long-tail usage distribution were not shared in the final report and therefore cannot be included in our analysis.\n\n6 GitHub  is  a  hosting  and  collaboration  platform  that  contributors  can  use  to  coordinate  the  development  and distribution of OSS projects. Founded in 2008, GitHub has become the largest hub for OSS development in the world. In January 2023, GitHub had more than 370 million repositories and over 100 million developers. In addition to personal users, a wide range of private firms actively use the GitHub platform, including Microsoft (which bought GitHub in 2018), Facebook, Google, and numerous other small and large firms.\n\n7 We attempted to access all repository URLs obtained as a sanity check to ensure they are in working condition. For those we could not access on GitHub, we manually found the correct URLs.\n\n8 As a robustness check, we randomly selected 50 package-repository matches derived from the Google Search method and we checked them by hand. All matches were manually confirmed to be correct providing additional support for the automated matching method.\n\nthese 160 unmatched packages (less than 8% of the Census sample of 2,000) with high confidence from our analysis.\n\nBuiltWith. The BuiltWith data contains scans of all public websites across the globe and identifies the technologies they use. Unlike the inward facing Census data which focus on the usage of OSS, the BuiltWith data scan for the use of both proprietary and OSS in firm websites without explicit differentiation. To separate OSS from proprietary software in BuiltWith, we turn to the subset of all open source web development software in the technology category that includes \"JavaScript and its libraries,\" which generates 778 observations corresponding to the NPM OSS category  in  the  Census  data.  There  are  two  reasons  for  this  sampling  choice.  First,  this  given category is constructed by BuiltWith and we use it as a proxy for OSS to separate it from pecuniary software.  Second,  JavaScript,  one  of  the  core  technologies  for  building  websites,  is  the  most popular programming language by usage on GitHub (GitHub, 2022) and thus enables us to capture the most important OSS from the demand side perspective. The scans include 8.8 million unique websites and 72.8 million corresponding observations of OSS usage from January 1 to November 16, 2020. Further, to ensure that we measure the value of OSS usage generated by the private sector,  we  match  the  adopting  domains  of  the  JavaScript-related  OSS  from  BuiltWith  with company websites recorded in Orbis, Compustat, and PitchBook, three commonly used databases of corporate activity that capture registered businesses across the world. Performing this match ensures that OSS used by non-commercial websites (e.g., an individual person's personal website) is excluded in our analysis. This results in a match-rate of 38.6%, which corresponds to around 3.4 million websites of distinct firms.\n\nFor the BuiltWith data, we cannot employ the first method we use for the Census (using libraries.io to help identify the repository URL) since only the technology names associated with the  packages  were  provided  by  BuiltWith,  and  other  information  (e.g.,  package  and  package manager  names)  is  not  included. 9 Hence,  we  start  by  performing  the  Google  Search  method mentioned above which results in a match of 695 packages to repositories. We then manually searched the Github URLs for 83 of the remaining unmatched packages, resulting in an addition of 46 packages. In total, for the BuiltWith data we were able to identify 741 out of 778 package-\n\n9 Since the package and package manager names are missing, a precise match using libraries.io was not feasible. Technology names are product names intended for customers and can be less technical and precise than the package names for internal development purposes. Thus, using technology names in a libraries.io search could cause significant ambiguity.\n\nrepository matches. As with the Census data, the remaining 37 unmatched packages (less than 5%) are dropped from our analysis because they had been deleted from GitHub.\n\nGHTorrent database. To obtain measures of the dispersion of the OSS value creation, we utilize  the  GHTorrent  database,  which  contains  the  entire  activity  history  on  GitHub  using GitHub's Representational State Transfer (REST) application programming interface (API). We leveraged  its  records  of  GitHub  repositories,  developer-level  commits,  and  developer  public profile information to estimate the contribution of each developer. We narrowed the sample for our developer contribution analysis in two steps. First, we winnowed the GitHub repositories and their  commits  from  GHTorrent  based  on  the  repository  URLs  of  our  joint  Census-BuiltWith sample. 10 Second, we focus on human contributions to OSS by removing approximately eight thousand (12%) GitHub contributors that we considered to be robots. 11 The final sample contains around sixty thousand developers and 2.3 million commits.\n\nTo prepare these three datasets for estimation, we first identified the number of lines of code and the programming languages used for each package using the OSS packages pygount (to count  the  number  of  lines  of  code)  and  linguist  (to  identify  programming  languages). 12 We categorize each distinct language into one of three different buckets moving from more likely human-written to more likely machine-written (see Table A1). Bucket 1 contains programming and markup languages (which are most likely to be human-written), bucket 3 contains data (most likely to be machine-written), and bucket 2 contains anything in between, such as config files and batch processing (which are sometimes human-written and sometimes machine-written, but it is difficult to tell based purely on looking at the code). 13 For our primary estimation we only use bucket 1 while providing robustness checks for buckets 2 and 3 in the Appendix, and thus our results represent a lower bound. Finally, for some analyses we dig deeper and show the top 5 programming languages (as classified by GitHub, 2022 for the year 2020; the year our data is from). The top 5 programming languages contain C (including C# and C++), Java, JavaScript,\n\n10 The match rate is over 96%, with the unmatched repositories accounting for only 0.15% of our calculated OSS demand value discussed below.\n\n11 The filtering is based on the 'fake user' classification by GHTorrent, as well as any usernames containing words 'bot' or 'robot', surrounded by special characters. This method is more conservative than other methods of bot detection  like  that  used  in  the  GitHub  Innovation  Graph  (https:\/\/innovationgraph.github.com\/),  which  rely  on  a monthly commit frequency threshold.\n\n12 https:\/\/pypi.org\/project\/pygount\/ and https:\/\/github.com\/github-linguist\/linguist\n\n13 Note that our focus is the cost to recreate OSS code written by humans, not robots. However, directly removing all OSS contributions from robot accounts is infeasible here, because we cannot observe the exact lines of code written by the robot accounts on GitHub.\n\nPython, and Typescript. We also add Go to this list of top languages since it is an increasingly widely used language in OSS.\n\nDocument 16: ## 5. Conclusion\n\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith. We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average value and distributed it across industries.\n\nIn this study we estimate the value of widely-used open source software globally with two unique datasets: the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data. We are able to estimate not only the supply side value of existing code (e.g., the cost it would take to rewrite each piece of widely-used OSS once) but also the demand side value for the private economy (e.g., the cost it would take for each company that uses a piece of OSS to rewrite it). While we do not focus on the long tail of OSS, we consider this an additional contribution of our study as focusing on OSS that is widely used allows us to more precisely understand the value created by OSS, rather than only measuring the  replacement  cost  for  all  OSS  (which  would  overestimate  the  true  value  since  many  OSS projects are not used in production code). However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n\nAdjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.  We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves.  Over  95%  percent  of  the  demand-side  value  is  generated  by  only  five  percent  of programmers, and those programmers contribute not only to a few widely used projects but to substantially more projects than the programmers that are engaged at the lower end of the value distribution.\n\nIn aggregate, our results show the substantial value that OSS contributes to the economy despite this value generally showing up as zero via direct measurement since prices equal zero and quantity is difficult to measure using public data alone. Our research lays the groundwork for future studies of not only OSS, but of all IT and its growing impact on the global economy.\n\nDocument 6: ## 1. Introduction\n\nIn 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that 'software is eating the world' (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that 'open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,' (Jacks, 2022). Other recent studies have come to similar conclusions showing that open source software  (OSS)  -  software  whose  source  code  is  publicly  available  for  inspection,  use,  and modification and is often created in a decentralized manner and distributed for free - appears in 96% of codebases (Synopsys 2023), and that some commercial software consists of up to 99.9% freely available OSS (Musseau et al., 2022). Although in its early days OSS frequently copied features from existing proprietary software, OSS today includes cutting edge technology in various fields including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, big data, and analytics.  However, despite the increasing importance of OSS to all software (and therefore to the entire economy), measuring its impact has been elusive. Traditionally, to measure the value created by a good or service,  economists  multiply  the  price  ( p )  times  the  quantity  sold  ( q ).  However,  in  OSS, p is generally zero since the source code is publicly available, and q is  unknown due to the limited number of restrictions around how the code may be copied and reused. For example, if a company downloads  a  piece  of  OSS  from  a  public  code  repository,  it  may  copy  it  thousands  of  times internally (legally) and then share it with suppliers or customers (also legally), so public download data is insufficient. Although some recent studies have sought to estimate the value of p (discussed below), data for estimating q has been unavailable or intractable for anything more than just a handful of OSS packages. Using newly collected data from multiple sources, the goal of this paper is to provide estimates for both p and q and to use those to shine light on the question: What is the value of open source software?\n\nUnderstanding the value of OSS is of critical importance not only due to the role it plays in the economy, but also due to it being one of the most successful and impactful modern examples of the centuries old economic concept of 'the commons' which run the risk of meeting the fate known as 'the tragedy of the commons.' This concept can trace its roots as far back as the 4 th -century BC philosopher Aristotle who wrote 'That which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care. Men pay most attention to what is their own and care less for what is common.'  (Aristotle,  1981).  William  Forster  Lloyd  (1833)  resurfaced  the  idea  in  modern economic thought by highlighting the example of shared tracts of land used for cattle grazing by\n\nmultiple cattle herders who each had an incentive to overuse the shared resource. Garrett Hardin (1968)  brought  the  concept  into  the  broader  zeitgeist  when  he  wrote  an  article  discussing  the problem entitled 'The Tragedy of the Commons.' Building on this work, Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for her research highlighting paths to avoiding the tragedy of the commons through community coordination efforts that did not necessitate government enforced laws to manage and guard the commons (Ostrom 1990). The parallels between shared grazing lands and shared digital infrastructure are palpable - the availability of communal grass to feed cattle, and in turn feed people, was critical to the agrarian economy, and the ability to not have to recreate code that someone else has already written is critical to the modern economy. Further, in both contexts, despite knowing grass and code are critical inputs to the economy, measuring their actual value is difficult. And, as the renowned mathematician and physicist Lord Kelvin is believed to have said, 'If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.' And if you cannot improve and maintain it, such common goods may crumble under the weight of their own success as they are overused, but underinvested in (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021). Therefore, measuring the value OSS creates is crucial to the future health of the digital economy, and the rest of the economy that is built on top of it.\n\nImportantly, recent studies have attempted to address these measurement issues but fall short of capturing both the breadth and depth of OSS usage - a gap we seek to fill with this paper. For example, researchers have attempted to gain breadth by using novel methodologies to estimate the labor replacement value of the current corpus of OSS created in the United States at $38 billion in 2019 (Robbins et al., 2021) and that created in the European Union at €1 billion (Blind et al., 2021) by imputing the labor costs that it would have taken to rewrite existing OSS. Such efforts do a very good job at estimating what it would cost to replace all existing OSS if it disappeared tomorrow. However, the resultant estimates rely on two important assumptions. First, that all OSS is equally valuable from a usage standpoint, and second that the concept of OSS would still exist, and society would just need to rewrite the code once, thus addressing the aforementioned problem of a missing value for p , but not addressing the missing value of q . In a world where OSS did not exist at all, then each piece of OSS software would not need to be rewritten just once, but instead would need to be rewritten by every firm that used the software (assuming the firm could freely share the software within its boundaries). Other research (Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; MurcianoGoroff, Zhuo, and Greenstein, 2021) has gone deeper into this hypothetical, albeit in a narrow\n\nmanner, by only focusing on web servers (which are public facing on the Internet and can therefore be readily measured). Using different methods, both studies measure q for this one type of software and impute p by using a goods replacement value approach based on the prices for closed-source alternatives offered by firms. With data from the United States the resulting estimates show a value of  $2  billion  for  the  OSS  Apache  Web  Server  in  2012  (Greenstein  and  Nagle,  2014)  and  a combined value of $4.5 billion for Apache and the increasingly popular OSS web server nginx in 2018 (Murciano-Goroff, et al., 2021). However, although web servers are an important part of the OSS  ecosystem,  they  constitute  a  small  portion  of  it.  We  seek  to  build  upon  the  important contributions this existing research has made in an attempt to go both broad and deep to create a more complete measure of the value of OSS.\n\nTo consider the value of OSS in both a broad and deep manner, we use data from two primary sources that allow us to gain insights into the OSS used at tens of thousands of firms across the world. The first is the 'Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries' (Nagle et al., 2022). The Census II project utilized partnerships with multiple software composition analysis (SCA) firms to create various lists of the most widely used OSS. SCAs are hired to scan the codebases of a company to ensure they are not violating any OSS licenses and, as a byproduct, track all the OSS code used by their customers and the products they build. The Census II project aggregated data from multiple SCAs to build a dataset of OSS usage at tens of thousands of firms based  on  millions  of  data  points  (observations  of  OSS  usage).  The  second  data  source  is  the BuiltWith dataset, from which we leverage scans of nearly nine million websites to identify the underlying technology deployed by these websites, including OSS libraries. The BuiltWith data has been used in multiple academic studies (DeStefano &amp; Timmis 2023, Dushnitsky &amp; Stroube 2021, Koning et al.. 2022), but to our knowledge this is the first one to focus on OSS usage. The Census II data and the BuiltWith data are complementary as the former focuses on OSS that is built  into  the  software  a  company  sells,  while  the  latter  focuses  on  OSS  that  is  built  into  a company's website, thus reducing the chances of double-counting observations across the datasets. In aggregate, these two datasets combined create the most complete measurement of OSS usage ( q ) to date. Further, by focusing on OSS that is widely deployed and used by firms, rather than considering all the projects that exist in an OSS repository, we enhance the methodologies of prior studies by reducing the likelihood of measurement error stemming from projects that are posted as publicly available OSS but are not actually used in any practical manner. Not accounting for this\n\nmeasurement error would lead to overestimation of the actual value of OSS as projects that are widely used would be valued in the same way as projects that are not used at all.\n\nTo estimate p ,  we  follow  the  literature  discussed  above  and  use  the  labor  replacement value. First, we calculate the labor cost it would take an individual firm to recreate a given OSS package by measuring the number of lines of code within the package and then applying the Constructive Cost Model II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) - also known as COCOMO II to estimate the number of person-hours it would take to write the code from scratch. We then utilize global wage data from Salary Expert to get an accurate estimate of the labor costs a firm would incur if this piece of OSS did not exist. These costs can be combined with the q values from above at the OSS package level to estimate the combined value of all OSS from both the supply and demand sides.\n\nWe find a value ranging from $1.22 billion to $6.22 billion if we were to decide as a society to recreate all widely used OSS on the supply side. However, considering the actual usage of OSS leads to a demand-side value that is orders of magnitude larger and ranges from $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion, if each firm who used an OSS package had to recreate it from scratch (e.g., the concept of OSS did not exist). We document substantial heterogeneity of the value of OSS by programming  language  and  internal  vs  outward-facing  programming  efforts.  Further,  we  find considerable  heterogeneity  in  value  contributions  by  programmers  as  5%  of  programmers  are responsible for more than 90% of the value created on the supply- and demand- side. The data we use is arguably the most comprehensive source of data to measure the value created by firm usage of OSS at this time. However, as for any project, the evidence is not complete and we argue that we underestimate the value since our data, e.g., does not include operating systems, which are a substantial omitted category of OSS.\n\nThis study makes four important contributions to the academic literature, practitioners, and policy makers. First, it provides the most complete estimate of the value of widely used OSS to date  by  accounting  for  not  only  the  supply-side  of  OSS  (price  to  create  it),  but  also  for  the usage\/demand-side at a scale that has not been done before. While prior estimates of the value of OSS only went either broad (estimating the supply-side costs of a large swath of OSS) or deep (estimating the value created by one particular type of OSS), this study does both by using unique datasets that allow for a better understanding of the breadth and depth of OSS usage. Further, rather than measuring the value of all OSS, this study focuses on the value of OSS that is used by firms\n\nto create its products and websites, limiting the measurement error occurring in studies that are unable to account for which OSS is actually used in production. This contribution builds upon, and extends, important research (e.g., Blind et al., 2021; Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021; Robbins et al., 2021) that has sought to identify the value of this vital resource that contributes a great deal to the modern economy despite the difficulties measuring this contribution. In  doing  so,  it  adds  insights  to  a  long-running  discussion  related  to  the  impact  of  information technology (IT) on productivity (Brynjolfsson, 1993; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 1996; Nagle, 2019a; Solow, 1987) known as the 'productivity paradox' where IT investments can have limited impact on productivity statistics. This debate has continued into the emerging context of AI (Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson, 2018). Our work contributes to this conversation by highlighting a massive societal level cost-savings (and hence productivity enhancement) that is created by the existence of OSS.\n\nSecond, our research contributes methodological advances to the study of intangible capital by highlighting novel sources of data related to investments in OSS. Prior research has shown that intangible capital plays an increasingly important role in economic growth (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel,  2009)  and  firm  value  (Peters  and  Taylor,  2017),  but  it  often  goes  unmeasured  or misattributed (Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou, 2014). Further, we demonstrate how these data sources can be used to understand the true investments in software that a firm makes, and that which they would have to make if OSS did not exist.  This  is  valuable  as  investments  in  software  are  an increasingly important type of intangible capital that is driving innovation (Branstetter, Drev, and Kwon, 2019) and performance (Krishnan et al., 2000).\n\nThird, our results help highlight for firms and managers the importance of OSS to their production, and ideally add weight to arguments that users of OSS should not just free ride but also contribute to the creation and maintenance of OSS (e.g., Henkel, 2008; Nagle, 2018). Such contributions are a fraction of the costs that firms would incur if OSS did not exist and the active participation of OSS users in helping maintain the OSS they use is critical to the health and future well-being of the OSS ecosystem (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021; Zhang et al., 2019).\n\nFourth,  and  finally,  our  study  helps  inform  policymakers  who  have  recently  started  to understand  the  growing  importance  of  OSS  to  the  economy  and  taken  actions  to  support  the ecosystem (European Commission, 2020; Executive Order No. 14028, 2021). However, most of these efforts are related to securing the existing OSS ecosystem, which is quite important, but do\n\nnot go as far as supporting the creation of new OSS. Our results help shine light on the importance of OSS to the overall economy and add weight to calls for more societal support of this critical resource. Our results further show that the majority of the value created by OSS is created by a small  number  of  contributors.  Although  it  has  long  been  known  that  a  small  number  of  OSS contributors do most of the work, we add new insights that show this is even more true for the value creation of widely-used OSS projects and that societal support for these individuals is critical to the future success of OSS, and in turn, the economy.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the empirical setting and data. Section 3 discusses the methods including measurement challenges. In section 4, we estimate the value of open source software.

We identify several OSS packages that have similar closed-source, pecuniary alternatives and consider the costs if all commercial users of the free OSS had to replace that software with a pecuniary alternative (similar to the calculations Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) performed for web servers). We can then use this alternate value of p , combined with the q values from above to estimate a goods replacement value of OSS. This method builds on suggestions from Nordhaus (2006, p. 146) who says '…the price of market and nonmarket goods and services should be imputed on the basis of the comparable market goods and services.' We do not expect the estimates from the two methods to be similar. Quite the contrary, the value of those two methods varies substantially since the latter goods-market approach assumes a fixed price to sell a good multiple times and that fixed price is usually lower than the total value estimated from recreating all packages on the labor side. The differential between these estimates is  essentially the result of a firm stepping in to reproduce the missing OSS packages and then selling them for a pecuniary price rather than all firms needing to reproduce those packages from scratch themselves.\n\nWith the goods market approach, the thought experiment is still that we live in a world where OSS does not exist, but it has to be recreated via one firm that then charges a price for a good that is currently free. To value OSS via the goods market approach, we created a basket of equivalent substitute proprietary goods that are priced on the open market as a stand-in for an OSS product.  This  methodology  is  consistent  with  that  used  in  the  prior  literature  (Greenstein  and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021) although both of those studies only used a single good rather than a basket since they were focused on only one type of OSS (web servers). Since there is no readily available database for proprietary equivalents of OSS, we conduct a search based on subjective  perception  of  popularity  of  OSS  and  we  then  search  for  pecuniary,  closed-source substitutes for them. The resulting basket of 20 OSS packages with proprietary substitutes is a good representation of the diversity of OSS. The software ranges from media and design software to statistical analysis programs, to database management and web server software. 21\n\n21 Table A5 shows the basket of OSS and their proprietary equivalents that we used. To create this basket, we looked for proprietary software that had an OSS equivalent that was similar in its overall function and feature set, and sought to identify pairs of software that, in aggregate, captured a broad and representative set of the types of OSS that exist.\n\nBased on our OSS equivalent substitute proprietary goods basket we then obtain prices for each proprietary software equivalent and we calculated the COCOMO labor market supply-side value for each OSS product in the basket which we use as a proxy - for lack of the code from the proprietary software - for the COCOMO labor supply side value of the proprietary software (e.g., the cost it would take to pay a programmer to write that proprietary software from scratch). We then calculate the average COCOMO labor supply-side value of the basket, 𝑉 !,1#23.4 ,  and  the average price for the basket, 𝑃 !,1#23.4 . 22 Since, we know the labor market supply-side value of all OSS, 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; , we can setup the following equation and obtain the price of OSS, 𝑃 ! for the goodsmarket for all OSS via a simple scaling transformation:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nThis results in the following goods-market supply-side value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nWe can then obtain the equivalent demand-side goods-market values as follows:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nFrom the goods market side, we consider the equivalent price that a firm would charge if it produced all existing widely used OSS and then sold it as a product to customers.\n\nTable A6, column 3 shows that the value on the demand side ranges between $177 million and $244 million across the different buckets independent of the country of origin from which programmers are hired. Naturally, the goods-market value will be substantially smaller than the labor demand value since this imaginary firm will make a profit at a comparatively low price by producing the software once and then selling it to many customers. Further, while Greenstein and Nagle (2014) as well as Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) focus on one particular type of software only (web servers), we attempt to expand on their approach to many goods. However, the data limitations become a stronger constraint in this context which makes it inherently more difficult\n\n22 We obtained the average price of the goods-market proprietary basket by using a 3 years lifespan of software, i.e. 1\/(1-0.66), so the depreciation factor is 0.33. This is consistent with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules for depreciating software, which states 'If you can depreciate the cost of computer software, use the straight line method over a useful life of 36 months.' https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/publications\/p946#en\\_US\\_2022\\_publink1000107354.\n\nto  estimate  the  value  through  this  approach  while  requiring  substantially  more  assumptions. Instead of a pure goods-market approach, this requires assistance from the labor-market approach in terms of scaling for the estimate, which ultimately leads to a substantial underestimate of the value of OSS. Further, the pricing strategy of the proprietary software counterparts is sensitive to the  market  demand.  With  the  goods-market  approach  extending  to  multiple  goods,  the  strong implicit assumption is that the market demands for our basket software and our sample OSS are similar, so they lead to commensurate prices.\n\nAn alternative and even more simplified goods-market back-of-the-envelope calculation that does not account for lines of code and relies on no scaling from the labor market approach would simply be to multiply a price of a reference good with the usage. We can take the minimum, average, and maximum prices of the basket of proprietary goods as captured in the reference price vector p = (69.99, 1610.17, 5800) and simply multiply it with usage from the combined Census and BuiltWith sample (Table 1). Based on those imputed proprietary price assumptions, the goods market demand side value would range from $0.2 - $16.5 trillion (minimum price - maximum price)  with  the  mean  price  resulting  in  a  value  estimate  of  $4.5  trillion.  However,  while  this estimate creates slightly more variance than the labor market approach, it is inherently flawed by simply assuming that the imputed prices are identical for each open source product based on the reference price. We further think this very simple back-of-the-envelope is an orange to apples comparison since the goods in our basket are fully functional, stand-alone software packages, while the packages in the Census and BuiltWith datasets are comprised of application libraries, which are generally smaller than such stand-alone packages.\n\nGiven all the complexities and assumptions one has to make due to lack of data for a goodsmarket approach, we place stronger emphasis on the labor cost approach highlighted in the main body but we include this method here for completeness.\n\nDocument 9: ## 3.1 Labor market approach\n\nFor the labor market approach, we estimate the value of OSS by calculating the replacement value of a package. We ask how much it would cost to reproduce the package by hiring a programmer and paying them a competitive market wage. To estimate this supply-side value ( 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; ) , we take the complete list of OSS packages discussed above, and then count the lines of code in each unique\n\n14 In an alternative version, we use a mixture of a labor and goods market approach that is more closely aligned with Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff, et al (2021). However, applying this method in our setting requires numerous additional assumptions due to data constraints. For simplicity we call it the goods market approach for which we provide the details and statistics, as well as the limitations in Appendix A.\n\npackage. 15 For each unique package,  , we calculate the value and then sum over all these values i to obtain the total value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nIn this calculation, we implicitly do not incorporate any production externalities since we assume that there is no spillover knowledge from one package to the next that would lower the cost of programming. 16 This methodology is similar to that used by other papers that estimate the supply-side costs of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021).\n\nWe then calculate the demand-side value of OSS by incorporating the usage information ( Q) for each package:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nHere, we do not incorporate consumption externalities, i.e., we do not allow a benefit to arise for the general public when a package has been created and we further make sure that each firm is only replacing a package they use once, since a replaced package can be used within a firm as a club good (e.g., see Cornes and Sandler, 1996). The value 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost to rewrite all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the concept of OSS still exists, but all of these packages needed to be rewritten from scratch), while the value 𝑉 + \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost for each firm that uses one of these OSS packages to pay a developer to rewrite those packages (e.g., OSS itself no longer exists).\n\nFor both the supply and demand models, we obtain the dollar-value for each package ( 𝑃 ( ) via the Constructive Cost Model II, also abbreviated as COCOMO II (Boehm 1984, Boehm et al. 2009). The model has previously been used by the United States Department of Defense to estimate software project costs as well as in prior research estimating the value of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021). It is a highly flexible model that allows us to create non-linear transformations of lines of code to dollar-values. It uses the following modelling equation:\n\n15 We use only the pure lines of code excluding documentation lines and empty lines. Hence, we underestimate the true value of recreating each package.\n\n16 Similar to a representative agent model (e.g. see Williamson 2006), one may think of each package being reproduced by separate programmers who are identical replicas of each other (and therefore have the same skill level, but do not become more efficient via learning).\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n( (\n\nwhere 𝐿 represents the lines of codes in thousands and E the effort in person-month units for each project  . Consistent with Blind et al. (2021), we use the default parameter values for i 𝛼 , 𝛽 and 𝜂. The parameters 𝛼 𝛽 , are non-linear adjustment factors set to 2.94, and 1.0997 respectively . The parameter 𝜂 is an effort-adjustment factor which can be modified to incorporate subjective assessments of product, hardware, personnel, and project attributes. Since we do not have a prior for each project, we set 𝜂 to the default value of one. To obtain the price ( 𝑃 ( ) of each OSS project, we  then  multiply  the  results  of  equation  (3)  by  the  weighted  global  wage  that  an  average programmer would obtain on the open market. To calculate a global wage, we include the base monthly salaries of software developers from Salary Expert for the top 30 countries in terms of their GitHub developer counts in 2021 (Wachs et al., 2022). 17 The weight of each country is its share of active GitHub contributors over the total contributors in the top 30 countries. We further create bounds by using a low-wage (India) and high-wage (USA) labor market for the wage to better understand how the value would vary by the pool of programmers used to recreate all of OSS. 18\n\nDocument 8: ## 3. Methodology\n\nWe first measure the value of OSS by considering the supply and the demand side of OSS using a labor market approach. 14 The thought experiment is that we live in a world where OSS does not exist and has to be recreated at each firm that uses a given piece of OSS. Using the labor market approach, we calculate the labor replacement cost of each OSS package. To estimate the value for each package, we use COCOMO II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) at the individual package level and then sum across all package values to obtain a supply-side labor market replacement value. Then, we scale the supply-side value by the number of times firms are using each package while removing multi-usage within each firm to obtain a demand-side value.\n\nSecond, we move beyond the aggregate and inspect inequality in the value creation process. In OSS, as with many creative endeavors, it is common that a small handful of individuals provide the bulk of the contributions, while many others make small contributions (sometimes referred to as the 80\/20 rule, implying 80% of the work is done by 20% of the people). Research has shown these frequent contributors often attain positions of influence in OSS communities as a result of their efforts (Hanisch, et al, 2018). Therefore, to better understand the dispersion of value creation across developers, we first use the GHTorrent data and identify individual developer contributions in two ways: a) through their OSS value contributions directly and b) through the total number of repositories they contributed to. We then test how concentrated these two contribution measures are to better understand whether many or few developers contribute to the total value we measure. We explain the exact details for the labor market approach and the inequality of valuations below.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"distracting element","seed_document_id":21,"distracting_context":"## --- Table 1 about here ---\n\nTable  1  shows  descriptive  statistics  from  both  data  sets  separately.  The  inward-facing Census  (Panel  A)  contains  just  over  261.7  million  lines  of  code  with  72%  of  the  lines  being attributable to the top programming languages. The average package includes 142 thousand lines of code with a slightly lower average of 113 thousand lines of code for the subset of top languages. When considering the demand (usage) side, we observe that the Census packages were used over 2.7 million times while 92% of this usage is attributable to the top languages. The average package was used 1,472.4 times with a higher usage of around 1,497.5 for the top  languages.  For  the outward-facing  BuiltWith  data  we  find  similar  patterns,  but  at  different  levels.  The  packages included from BuiltWith include over 82 million lines of code, 71% of which are attributable to the  top  programming  languages.  The  average  package  within  the  BuiltWith  sample  has  111 thousand  lines  of  code  with  a  lower  average  of  around  80  thousand  lines  of  code  for  the  top languages. This is because our BuiltWith data primarily consists of JavaScript-based packages, which are often smaller than packages written in other languages. BuiltWith packages were used over 142 thousand times where 99.97% were attributable to the top languages. Next, we used these raw observations to calculate the value of all OSS through the labor market approach and estimated the value created from the supply and demand side.\n\n--- Table 2 about here ---\n\nTable 2 shows the estimates for the value of OSS based on the firm-relevant joint Census and BuiltWith sample. All estimates in Table 2 are based only on software languages classified in bucket  1  from  Table  A1,  which  are  the  most  likely  to  be  written  by  a  human  rather  than  a machine. 19 The first column contains estimates with wages from a low income country (India), the global  average  wage,  and  a  high  income  country  (United  States  of  America),  respectively  (as described above). To reproduce all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the idea of OSS still exists, but all current OSS is deleted and needs to be coded from scratch), using programmers at the average developer wage from India, it would require an investment of $1.22 billion. In contrast, if we use the average developer wage from the United States, then reproducing all widely-used OSS would require  an  investment  of  $6.22  billion.  Using  a  pool  of  programmers  from  across  the  world, weighed based on the existing geographic contributions to OSS as discussed above, would lead to an investment somewhere in between the low and high-income country, $4.15 billion. It is useful to compare these numbers to those from similar studies to understand differences in valuing all OSS (prior studies) versus that which is widely used (our study). Robbins et al. (2021) and Blind et al. (2021) use a method similar to ours and estimate that the value of OSS created in the US is $38 billion in 2019 and that created in the EU is €1 billion in 2018. Wachs et al. (2022) show that roughly 50% of OSS contributions come from the US and EU combined. In aggregate, that would lead these studies to give a global value of OSS of $78 billion. Thus, our middle estimate of a supply-side value of $4.15 billion for only firm-oriented and widely used OSS is a credible lowerbound and highlights the higher estimations of the total of supply-side value of OSS when not considering whether or not a given OSS package is widely used. This further indicates that the supply-side value of the most widely used OSS is roughly 5.5% of the supply-side value of all OSS.\n\nThe second column in Table 2 contains the demand side estimates based on the labor market approach. We find that if firms had to recreate all OSS packages they used (e.g., OSS itself no longer existed and every firm that used an OSS package had to recreate it), then the entire cost would amount to between $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion using labor from the low wage or high wage country only, respectively. A pool of programmers across the globe could recreate all of OSS that is being widely used for a cost of approximately $8.80 trillion. Interpreting this number is\n\n19 Tables in the appendix show the equivalent values from Table 2 when including software language buckets 1 and 2 (Table A3) and all three software language buckets (Table A4).\n\nslightly more complicated but still feasible. According to a Statista (2023) report, global software revenue in 2020 (the same year as our data) was $531.7 billion. However, this represents a flow, not a stock, of software. Relying on government estimates that software fully depreciates over three years, we can do a back of the envelope calculation and consider the purchase value of the full stock of prepackaged software used in 2020 as the aggregate of that sold from 2018 to 2020, which is $1.54 trillion. Further, this represents only the expenditure on prepackaged software and does  not  include  custom  purchased  or  in-house  developed  software.  Here,  the  best  obtainable estimates of private-sector investment in software overall come from the United States National Income and Product Accounts data (NIPA 2023). In 2020, the national account data shows that in the  US,  private  firms  spent  $479.2  billion  on  software,  of  which  45%  ($215.5  billion)  was prepackaged. If we assume this is a consistent ratio for the rest of the world, then the total amount firms spent on software being used in 2020 was $3.4 trillion (= $1.54 trillion\/0.45). Combining this rough estimate with the demand side estimate of the value of OSS based on an average global wage ($8.8 trillion), this indicates firms would spend $12.2 trillion (=$3.4 trillion + $8.8 trillion), or three and a half times what they currently spend if they needed to pay in-house developers to write the OSS that they currently use for free.","topic":"Others"}}

Introduction\n\nIn 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that 'software is eating the world' (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that 'open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,' (Jacks, 2022). Other recent studies have come to similar conclusions showing that open source software  (OSS)  -  software  whose  source  code  is  publicly  available  for  inspection,  use,  and modification and is often created in a decentralized manner and distributed for free - appears in 96% of codebases (Synopsys 2023), and that some commercial software consists of up to 99.9% freely available OSS (Musseau et al., 2022). Although in its early days OSS frequently copied features from existing proprietary software, OSS today includes cutting edge technology in various fields including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, big data, and analytics.  However, despite the increasing importance of OSS to all software (and therefore to the entire economy), measuring its impact has been elusive. Traditionally, to measure the value created by a good or service,  economists  multiply  the  price  ( p )  times  the  quantity  sold  ( q ).  However,  in  OSS, p is generally zero since the source code is publicly available, and q is  unknown due to the limited number of restrictions around how the code may be copied and reused. For example, if a company downloads  a  piece  of  OSS  from  a  public  code  repository,  it  may  copy  it  thousands  of  times internally (legally) and then share it with suppliers or customers (also legally), so public download data is insufficient. Although some recent studies have sought to estimate the value of p (discussed below), data for estimating q has been unavailable or intractable for anything more than just a handful of OSS packages. Using newly collected data from multiple sources, the goal of this paper is to provide estimates for both p and q and to use those to shine light on the question: What is the value of open source software?\n\nUnderstanding the value of OSS is of critical importance not only due to the role it plays in the economy, but also due to it being one of the most successful and impactful modern examples of the centuries old economic concept of 'the commons' which run the risk of meeting the fate known as 'the tragedy of the commons.' This concept can trace its roots as far back as the 4 th -century BC philosopher Aristotle who wrote 'That which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care. Men pay most attention to what is their own and care less for what is common.'  (Aristotle,  1981).  William  Forster  Lloyd  (1833)  resurfaced  the  idea  in  modern economic thought by highlighting the example of shared tracts of land used for cattle grazing by\n\nmultiple cattle herders who each had an incentive to overuse the shared resource. Garrett Hardin (1968)  brought  the  concept  into  the  broader  zeitgeist  when  he  wrote  an  article  discussing  the problem entitled 'The Tragedy of the Commons.' Building on this work, Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for her research highlighting paths to avoiding the tragedy of the commons through community coordination efforts that did not necessitate government enforced laws to manage and guard the commons (Ostrom 1990). The parallels between shared grazing lands and shared digital infrastructure are palpable - the availability of communal grass to feed cattle, and in turn feed people, was critical to the agrarian economy, and the ability to not have to recreate code that someone else has already written is critical to the modern economy. Further, in both contexts, despite knowing grass and code are critical inputs to the economy, measuring their actual value is difficult. And, as the renowned mathematician and physicist Lord Kelvin is believed to have said, 'If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.' And if you cannot improve and maintain it, such common goods may crumble under the weight of their own success as they are overused, but underinvested in (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021). Therefore, measuring the value OSS creates is crucial to the future health of the digital economy, and the rest of the economy that is built on top of it.\n\nImportantly, recent studies have attempted to address these measurement issues but fall short of capturing both the breadth and depth of OSS usage - a gap we seek to fill with this paper. For example, researchers have attempted to gain breadth by using novel methodologies to estimate the labor replacement value of the current corpus of OSS created in the United States at $38 billion in 2019 (Robbins et al., 2021) and that created in the European Union at €1 billion (Blind et al., 2021) by imputing the labor costs that it would have taken to rewrite existing OSS. Such efforts do a very good job at estimating what it would cost to replace all existing OSS if it disappeared tomorrow. However, the resultant estimates rely on two important assumptions. First, that all OSS is equally valuable from a usage standpoint, and second that the concept of OSS would still exist, and society would just need to rewrite the code once, thus addressing the aforementioned problem of a missing value for p , but not addressing the missing value of q . In a world where OSS did not exist at all, then each piece of OSS software would not need to be rewritten just once, but instead would need to be rewritten by every firm that used the software (assuming the firm could freely share the software within its boundaries). Other research (Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; MurcianoGoroff, Zhuo, and Greenstein, 2021) has gone deeper into this hypothetical, albeit in a narrow\n\nmanner, by only focusing on web servers (which are public facing on the Internet and can therefore be readily measured). Using different methods, both studies measure q for this one type of software and impute p by using a goods replacement value approach based on the prices for closed-source alternatives offered by firms. With data from the United States the resulting estimates show a value of  $2  billion  for  the  OSS  Apache  Web  Server  in  2012  (Greenstein  and  Nagle,  2014)  and  a combined value of $4.5 billion for Apache and the increasingly popular OSS web server nginx in 2018 (Murciano-Goroff, et al., 2021). However, although web servers are an important part of the OSS  ecosystem,  they  constitute  a  small  portion  of  it.  We  seek  to  build  upon  the  important contributions this existing research has made in an attempt to go both broad and deep to create a more complete measure of the value of OSS.\n\nTo consider the value of OSS in both a broad and deep manner, we use data from two primary sources that allow us to gain insights into the OSS used at tens of thousands of firms across the world. The first is the 'Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries' (Nagle et al., 2022). The Census II project utilized partnerships with multiple software composition analysis (SCA) firms to create various lists of the most widely used OSS. SCAs are hired to scan the codebases of a company to ensure they are not violating any OSS licenses and, as a byproduct, track all the OSS code used by their customers and the products they build. The Census II project aggregated data from multiple SCAs to build a dataset of OSS usage at tens of thousands of firms based  on  millions  of  data  points  (observations  of  OSS  usage).  The  second  data  source  is  the BuiltWith dataset, from which we leverage scans of nearly nine million websites to identify the underlying technology deployed by these websites, including OSS libraries. The BuiltWith data has been used in multiple academic studies (DeStefano &amp; Timmis 2023, Dushnitsky &amp; Stroube 2021, Koning et al.. 2022), but to our knowledge this is the first one to focus on OSS usage. The Census II data and the BuiltWith data are complementary as the former focuses on OSS that is built  into  the  software  a  company  sells,  while  the  latter  focuses  on  OSS  that  is  built  into  a company's website, thus reducing the chances of double-counting observations across the datasets. In aggregate, these two datasets combined create the most complete measurement of OSS usage ( q ) to date. Further, by focusing on OSS that is widely deployed and used by firms, rather than considering all the projects that exist in an OSS repository, we enhance the methodologies of prior studies by reducing the likelihood of measurement error stemming from projects that are posted as publicly available OSS but are not actually used in any practical manner. Not accounting for this\n\nmeasurement error would lead to overestimation of the actual value of OSS as projects that are widely used would be valued in the same way as projects that are not used at all.\n\nTo estimate p ,  we  follow  the  literature  discussed  above  and  use  the  labor  replacement value. First, we calculate the labor cost it would take an individual firm to recreate a given OSS package by measuring the number of lines of code within the package and then applying the Constructive Cost Model II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) - also known as COCOMO II to estimate the number of person-hours it would take to write the code from scratch. We then utilize global wage data from Salary Expert to get an accurate estimate of the labor costs a firm would incur if this piece of OSS did not exist. These costs can be combined with the q values from above at the OSS package level to estimate the combined value of all OSS from both the supply and demand sides.\n\nWe find a value ranging from $1.22 billion to $6.22 billion if we were to decide as a society to recreate all widely used OSS on the supply side. However, considering the actual usage of OSS leads to a demand-side value that is orders of magnitude larger and ranges from $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion, if each firm who used an OSS package had to recreate it from scratch (e.g., the concept of OSS did not exist). We document substantial heterogeneity of the value of OSS by programming  language  and  internal  vs  outward-facing  programming  efforts.  Further,  we  find considerable  heterogeneity  in  value  contributions  by  programmers  as  5%  of  programmers  are responsible for more than 90% of the value created on the supply- and demand- side. The data we use is arguably the most comprehensive source of data to measure the value created by firm usage of OSS at this time. However, as for any project, the evidence is not complete and we argue that we underestimate the value since our data, e.g., does not include operating systems, which are a substantial omitted category of OSS.\n\nThis study makes four important contributions to the academic literature, practitioners, and policy makers. First, it provides the most complete estimate of the value of widely used OSS to date  by  accounting  for  not  only  the  supply-side  of  OSS  (price  to  create  it),  but  also  for  the usage\/demand-side at a scale that has not been done before. While prior estimates of the value of OSS only went either broad (estimating the supply-side costs of a large swath of OSS) or deep (estimating the value created by one particular type of OSS), this study does both by using unique datasets that allow for a better understanding of the breadth and depth of OSS usage. Further, rather than measuring the value of all OSS, this study focuses on the value of OSS that is used by firms\n\nto create its products and websites, limiting the measurement error occurring in studies that are unable to account for which OSS is actually used in production. This contribution builds upon, and extends, important research (e.g., Blind et al., 2021; Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021; Robbins et al., 2021) that has sought to identify the value of this vital resource that contributes a great deal to the modern economy despite the difficulties measuring this contribution. In  doing  so,  it  adds  insights  to  a  long-running  discussion  related  to  the  impact  of  information technology (IT) on productivity (Brynjolfsson, 1993; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 1996; Nagle, 2019a; Solow, 1987) known as the 'productivity paradox' where IT investments can have limited impact on productivity statistics. This debate has continued into the emerging context of AI (Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson, 2018). Our work contributes to this conversation by highlighting a massive societal level cost-savings (and hence productivity enhancement) that is created by the existence of OSS.\n\nSecond, our research contributes methodological advances to the study of intangible capital by highlighting novel sources of data related to investments in OSS. Prior research has shown that intangible capital plays an increasingly important role in economic growth (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel,  2009)  and  firm  value  (Peters  and  Taylor,  2017),  but  it  often  goes  unmeasured  or misattributed (Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou, 2014). Further, we demonstrate how these data sources can be used to understand the true investments in software that a firm makes, and that which they would have to make if OSS did not exist.  This  is  valuable  as  investments  in  software  are  an increasingly important type of intangible capital that is driving innovation (Branstetter, Drev, and Kwon, 2019) and performance (Krishnan et al., 2000).\n\nThird, our results help highlight for firms and managers the importance of OSS to their production, and ideally add weight to arguments that users of OSS should not just free ride but also contribute to the creation and maintenance of OSS (e.g., Henkel, 2008; Nagle, 2018). Such contributions are a fraction of the costs that firms would incur if OSS did not exist and the active participation of OSS users in helping maintain the OSS they use is critical to the health and future well-being of the OSS ecosystem (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021; Zhang et al., 2019).\n\nFourth,  and  finally,  our  study  helps  inform  policymakers  who  have  recently  started  to understand  the  growing  importance  of  OSS  to  the  economy  and  taken  actions  to  support  the ecosystem (European Commission, 2020; Executive Order No. 14028, 2021). However, most of these efforts are related to securing the existing OSS ecosystem, which is quite important, but do\n\nnot go as far as supporting the creation of new OSS. Our results help shine light on the importance of OSS to the overall economy and add weight to calls for more societal support of this critical resource. Our results further show that the majority of the value created by OSS is created by a small  number  of  contributors.  Although  it  has  long  been  known  that  a  small  number  of  OSS contributors do most of the work, we add new insights that show this is even more true for the value creation of widely-used OSS projects and that societal support for these individuals is critical to the future success of OSS, and in turn, the economy.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the empirical setting and data. Section 3 discusses the methods including measurement challenges. In section 4, we estimate the value of open source software. Section 5 concludes.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"distracting element","seed_document_id":17,"distracting_context":"## 5. Conclusion\n\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith. We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average value and distributed it across industries.\n\nIn this study we estimate the value of widely-used open source software globally with two unique datasets: the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data. We are able to estimate not only the supply side value of existing code (e.g., the cost it would take to rewrite each piece of widely-used OSS once) but also the demand side value for the private economy (e.g., the cost it would take for each company that uses a piece of OSS to rewrite it). While we do not focus on the long tail of OSS, we consider this an additional contribution of our study as focusing on OSS that is widely used allows us to more precisely understand the value created by OSS, rather than only measuring the  replacement  cost  for  all  OSS  (which  would  overestimate  the  true  value  since  many  OSS projects are not used in production code). However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n\nAdjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.  We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves.  Over  95%  percent  of  the  demand-side  value  is  generated  by  only  five  percent  of programmers, and those programmers contribute not only to a few widely used projects but to substantially more projects than the programmers that are engaged at the lower end of the value distribution.\n\nIn aggregate, our results show the substantial value that OSS contributes to the economy despite this value generally showing up as zero via direct measurement since prices equal zero and quantity is difficult to measure using public data alone. Our research lays the groundwork for future studies of not only OSS, but of all IT and its growing impact on the global economy.","topic":"Others"}}

Additionally, the report inspects inequality in the value creation process by analyzing individual developer contributions using GHTorrent data.","reference_context":"Document 8: ## 3. Methodology\n\nWe first measure the value of OSS by considering the supply and the demand side of OSS using a labor market approach. 14 The thought experiment is that we live in a world where OSS does not exist and has to be recreated at each firm that uses a given piece of OSS. Using the labor market approach, we calculate the labor replacement cost of each OSS package. To estimate the value for each package, we use COCOMO II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) at the individual package level and then sum across all package values to obtain a supply-side labor market replacement value. Then, we scale the supply-side value by the number of times firms are using each package while removing multi-usage within each firm to obtain a demand-side value.\n\nSecond, we move beyond the aggregate and inspect inequality in the value creation process. In OSS, as with many creative endeavors, it is common that a small handful of individuals provide the bulk of the contributions, while many others make small contributions (sometimes referred to as the 80\/20 rule, implying 80% of the work is done by 20% of the people). Research has shown these frequent contributors often attain positions of influence in OSS communities as a result of their efforts (Hanisch, et al, 2018). Therefore, to better understand the dispersion of value creation across developers, we first use the GHTorrent data and identify individual developer contributions in two ways: a) through their OSS value contributions directly and b) through the total number of repositories they contributed to. We then test how concentrated these two contribution measures are to better understand whether many or few developers contribute to the total value we measure. We explain the exact details for the labor market approach and the inequality of valuations below.\n\nDocument 9: ## 3.1 Labor market approach\n\nFor the labor market approach, we estimate the value of OSS by calculating the replacement value of a package. We ask how much it would cost to reproduce the package by hiring a programmer and paying them a competitive market wage. To estimate this supply-side value ( 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; ) , we take the complete list of OSS packages discussed above, and then count the lines of code in each unique\n\n14 In an alternative version, we use a mixture of a labor and goods market approach that is more closely aligned with Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff, et al (2021). However, applying this method in our setting requires numerous additional assumptions due to data constraints. For simplicity we call it the goods market approach for which we provide the details and statistics, as well as the limitations in Appendix A.\n\npackage. 15 For each unique package,  , we calculate the value and then sum over all these values i to obtain the total value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nIn this calculation, we implicitly do not incorporate any production externalities since we assume that there is no spillover knowledge from one package to the next that would lower the cost of programming. 16 This methodology is similar to that used by other papers that estimate the supply-side costs of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021).\n\nWe then calculate the demand-side value of OSS by incorporating the usage information ( Q) for each package:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nHere, we do not incorporate consumption externalities, i.e., we do not allow a benefit to arise for the general public when a package has been created and we further make sure that each firm is only replacing a package they use once, since a replaced package can be used within a firm as a club good (e.g., see Cornes and Sandler, 1996). The value 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost to rewrite all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the concept of OSS still exists, but all of these packages needed to be rewritten from scratch), while the value 𝑉 + \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost for each firm that uses one of these OSS packages to pay a developer to rewrite those packages (e.g., OSS itself no longer exists).\n\nFor both the supply and demand models, we obtain the dollar-value for each package ( 𝑃 ( ) via the Constructive Cost Model II, also abbreviated as COCOMO II (Boehm 1984, Boehm et al. 2009). The model has previously been used by the United States Department of Defense to estimate software project costs as well as in prior research estimating the value of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021).

We further create bounds by using a low-wage (India) and high-wage (USA) labor market for the wage to better understand how the value would vary by the pool of programmers used to recreate all of OSS. 18\n\nDocument 11: ## 4. Results\n\nAfter applying the labor market approach using COCOMO II, we obtain global estimates for the value of OSS. To calculate the overall value, we first need the underlying number of lines of code (to calculate the supply-side value) and then the usage statistics (for the demand-side value). Since there may be substantial heterogeneity in value by programming languages, we also show the top programming languages during our investigation period in the year 2020, as discussed above.\n\nDocument 21: ## Appendix A) Goods-Market Valuation Approach\n\nAs an alternate estimation method, instead of using the labor replacement cost, we use a goods replacement value approach. We identify several OSS packages that have similar closed-source, pecuniary alternatives and consider the costs if all commercial users of the free OSS had to replace that software with a pecuniary alternative (similar to the calculations Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) performed for web servers). We can then use this alternate value of p , combined with the q values from above to estimate a goods replacement value of OSS. This method builds on suggestions from Nordhaus (2006, p. 146) who says '…the price of market and nonmarket goods and services should be imputed on the basis of the comparable market goods and services.' We do not expect the estimates from the two methods to be similar. Quite the contrary, the value of those two methods varies substantially since the latter goods-market approach assumes a fixed price to sell a good multiple times and that fixed price is usually lower than the total value estimated from recreating all packages on the labor side. The differential between these estimates is  essentially the result of a firm stepping in to reproduce the missing OSS packages and then selling them for a pecuniary price rather than all firms needing to reproduce those packages from scratch themselves.\n\nWith the goods market approach, the thought experiment is still that we live in a world where OSS does not exist, but it has to be recreated via one firm that then charges a price for a good that is currently free. To value OSS via the goods market approach, we created a basket of equivalent substitute proprietary goods that are priced on the open market as a stand-in for an OSS product.  This  methodology  is  consistent  with  that  used  in  the  prior  literature  (Greenstein  and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021) although both of those studies only used a single good rather than a basket since they were focused on only one type of OSS (web servers). Since there is no readily available database for proprietary equivalents of OSS, we conduct a search based on subjective  perception  of  popularity  of  OSS  and  we  then  search  for  pecuniary,  closed-source substitutes for them. The resulting basket of 20 OSS packages with proprietary substitutes is a good representation of the diversity of OSS. The software ranges from media and design software to statistical analysis programs, to database management and web server software. 21\n\n21 Table A5 shows the basket of OSS and their proprietary equivalents that we used. To create this basket, we looked for proprietary software that had an OSS equivalent that was similar in its overall function and feature set, and sought to identify pairs of software that, in aggregate, captured a broad and representative set of the types of OSS that exist.\n\nBased on our OSS equivalent substitute proprietary goods basket we then obtain prices for each proprietary software equivalent and we calculated the COCOMO labor market supply-side value for each OSS product in the basket which we use as a proxy - for lack of the code from the proprietary software - for the COCOMO labor supply side value of the proprietary software (e.g., the cost it would take to pay a programmer to write that proprietary software from scratch). We then calculate the average COCOMO labor supply-side value of the basket, 𝑉 !,1#23.4 ,  and  the average price for the basket, 𝑃 !,1#23.4 . 22 Since, we know the labor market supply-side value of all OSS, 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; , we can setup the following equation and obtain the price of OSS, 𝑃 ! for the goodsmarket for all OSS via a simple scaling transformation:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nThis results in the following goods-market supply-side value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nWe can then obtain the equivalent demand-side goods-market values as follows:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nFrom the goods market side, we consider the equivalent price that a firm would charge if it produced all existing widely used OSS and then sold it as a product to customers.\n\nTable A6, column 3 shows that the value on the demand side ranges between $177 million and $244 million across the different buckets independent of the country of origin from which programmers are hired. Naturally, the goods-market value will be substantially smaller than the labor demand value since this imaginary firm will make a profit at a comparatively low price by producing the software once and then selling it to many customers. Further, while Greenstein and Nagle (2014) as well as Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) focus on one particular type of software only (web servers), we attempt to expand on their approach to many goods. However, the data limitations become a stronger constraint in this context which makes it inherently more difficult\n\n22 We obtained the average price of the goods-market proprietary basket by using a 3 years lifespan of software, i.e. 1\/(1-0.66), so the depreciation factor is 0.33. This is consistent with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules for depreciating software, which states 'If you can depreciate the cost of computer software, use the straight line method over a useful life of 36 months.' https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/publications\/p946#en\\_US\\_2022\\_publink1000107354.\n\nto  estimate  the  value  through  this  approach  while  requiring  substantially  more  assumptions. Instead of a pure goods-market approach, this requires assistance from the labor-market approach in terms of scaling for the estimate, which ultimately leads to a substantial underestimate of the value of OSS. Further, the pricing strategy of the proprietary software counterparts is sensitive to the  market  demand.  With  the  goods-market  approach  extending  to  multiple  goods,  the  strong implicit assumption is that the market demands for our basket software and our sample OSS are similar, so they lead to commensurate prices.\n\nAn alternative and even more simplified goods-market back-of-the-envelope calculation that does not account for lines of code and relies on no scaling from the labor market approach would simply be to multiply a price of a reference good with the usage. We can take the minimum, average, and maximum prices of the basket of proprietary goods as captured in the reference price vector p = (69.99, 1610.17, 5800) and simply multiply it with usage from the combined Census and BuiltWith sample (Table 1). Based on those imputed proprietary price assumptions, the goods market demand side value would range from $0.2 - $16.5 trillion (minimum price - maximum price)  with  the  mean  price  resulting  in  a  value  estimate  of  $4.5  trillion.  However,  while  this estimate creates slightly more variance than the labor market approach, it is inherently flawed by simply assuming that the imputed prices are identical for each open source product based on the reference price. We further think this very simple back-of-the-envelope is an orange to apples comparison since the goods in our basket are fully functional, stand-alone software packages, while the packages in the Census and BuiltWith datasets are comprised of application libraries, which are generally smaller than such stand-alone packages.\n\nGiven all the complexities and assumptions one has to make due to lack of data for a goodsmarket approach, we place stronger emphasis on the labor cost approach highlighted in the main body but we include this method here for completeness.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"distracting element","seed_document_id":8,"distracting_context":"## 3.1 Labor market approach\n\nFor the labor market approach, we estimate the value of OSS by calculating the replacement value of a package.

For simplicity we call it the goods market approach for which we provide the details and statistics, as well as the limitations in Appendix A.\n\npackage. 15 For each unique package,  , we calculate the value and then sum over all these values i to obtain the total value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nIn this calculation, we implicitly do not incorporate any production externalities since we assume that there is no spillover knowledge from one package to the next that would lower the cost of programming. 16 This methodology is similar to that used by other papers that estimate the supply-side costs of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021).\n\nWe then calculate the demand-side value of OSS by incorporating the usage information ( Q) for each package:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nHere, we do not incorporate consumption externalities, i.e., we do not allow a benefit to arise for the general public when a package has been created and we further make sure that each firm is only replacing a package they use once, since a replaced package can be used within a firm as a club good (e.g., see Cornes and Sandler, 1996). The value 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost to rewrite all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the concept of OSS still exists, but all of these packages needed to be rewritten from scratch), while the value 𝑉 + \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost for each firm that uses one of these OSS packages to pay a developer to rewrite those packages (e.g., OSS itself no longer exists).\n\nFor both the supply and demand models, we obtain the dollar-value for each package ( 𝑃 ( ) via the Constructive Cost Model II, also abbreviated as COCOMO II (Boehm 1984, Boehm et al. 2009).

The  inward-facing Census  (Panel  A)  contains  just  over  261.7  million  lines  of  code  with  72%  of  the  lines  being attributable to the top programming languages. The average package includes 142 thousand lines of code with a slightly lower average of 113 thousand lines of code for the subset of top languages. When considering the demand (usage) side, we observe that the Census packages were used over 2.7 million times while 92% of this usage is attributable to the top languages. The average package was used 1,472.4 times with a higher usage of around 1,497.5 for the top  languages.  For  the outward-facing  BuiltWith  data  we  find  similar  patterns,  but  at  different  levels.  The  packages included from BuiltWith include over 82 million lines of code, 71% of which are attributable to the  top  programming  languages.  The  average  package  within  the  BuiltWith  sample  has  111 thousand  lines  of  code  with  a  lower  average  of  around  80  thousand  lines  of  code  for  the  top languages. This is because our BuiltWith data primarily consists of JavaScript-based packages, which are often smaller than packages written in other languages. BuiltWith packages were used over 142 thousand times where 99.97% were attributable to the top languages. Next, we used these raw observations to calculate the value of all OSS through the labor market approach and estimated the value created from the supply and demand side.\n\n--- Table 2 about here ---\n\nTable 2 shows the estimates for the value of OSS based on the firm-relevant joint Census and BuiltWith sample. All estimates in Table 2 are based only on software languages classified in bucket  1  from  Table  A1,  which  are  the  most  likely  to  be  written  by  a  human  rather  than  a machine. 19 The first column contains estimates with wages from a low income country (India), the global  average  wage,  and  a  high  income  country  (United  States  of  America),  respectively  (as described above). To reproduce all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the idea of OSS still exists, but all current OSS is deleted and needs to be coded from scratch), using programmers at the average developer wage from India, it would require an investment of $1.22 billion. In contrast, if we use the average developer wage from the United States, then reproducing all widely-used OSS would require  an  investment  of  $6.22  billion.  Using  a  pool  of  programmers  from  across  the  world, weighed based on the existing geographic contributions to OSS as discussed above, would lead to an investment somewhere in between the low and high-income country, $4.15 billion. It is useful to compare these numbers to those from similar studies to understand differences in valuing all OSS (prior studies) versus that which is widely used (our study). Robbins et al. (2021) and Blind et al. (2021) use a method similar to ours and estimate that the value of OSS created in the US is $38 billion in 2019 and that created in the EU is €1 billion in 2018. Wachs et al. (2022) show that roughly 50% of OSS contributions come from the US and EU combined. In aggregate, that would lead these studies to give a global value of OSS of $78 billion. Thus, our middle estimate of a supply-side value of $4.15 billion for only firm-oriented and widely used OSS is a credible lowerbound and highlights the higher estimations of the total of supply-side value of OSS when not considering whether or not a given OSS package is widely used. This further indicates that the supply-side value of the most widely used OSS is roughly 5.5% of the supply-side value of all OSS.\n\nThe second column in Table 2 contains the demand side estimates based on the labor market approach. We find that if firms had to recreate all OSS packages they used (e.g., OSS itself no longer existed and every firm that used an OSS package had to recreate it), then the entire cost would amount to between $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion using labor from the low wage or high wage country only, respectively. A pool of programmers across the globe could recreate all of OSS that is being widely used for a cost of approximately $8.80 trillion. Interpreting this number is\n\n19 Tables in the appendix show the equivalent values from Table 2 when including software language buckets 1 and 2 (Table A3) and all three software language buckets (Table A4).\n\nslightly more complicated but still feasible. According to a Statista (2023) report, global software revenue in 2020 (the same year as our data) was $531.7 billion. However, this represents a flow, not a stock, of software. Relying on government estimates that software fully depreciates over three years, we can do a back of the envelope calculation and consider the purchase value of the full stock of prepackaged software used in 2020 as the aggregate of that sold from 2018 to 2020, which is $1.54 trillion. Further, this represents only the expenditure on prepackaged software and does  not  include  custom  purchased  or  in-house  developed  software.  Here,  the  best  obtainable estimates of private-sector investment in software overall come from the United States National Income and Product Accounts data (NIPA 2023). In 2020, the national account data shows that in the  US,  private  firms  spent  $479.2  billion  on  software,  of  which  45%  ($215.5  billion)  was prepackaged. If we assume this is a consistent ratio for the rest of the world, then the total amount firms spent on software being used in 2020 was $3.4 trillion (= $1.54 trillion\/0.45). Combining this rough estimate with the demand side estimate of the value of OSS based on an average global wage ($8.8 trillion), this indicates firms would spend $12.2 trillion (=$3.4 trillion + $8.8 trillion), or three and a half times what they currently spend if they needed to pay in-house developers to write the OSS that they currently use for free.","topic":"Others"}}

Conclusion\n\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith. We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average value and distributed it across industries.\n\nIn this study we estimate the value of widely-used open source software globally with two unique datasets: the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data. We are able to estimate not only the supply side value of existing code (e.g., the cost it would take to rewrite each piece of widely-used OSS once) but also the demand side value for the private economy (e.g., the cost it would take for each company that uses a piece of OSS to rewrite it). While we do not focus on the long tail of OSS, we consider this an additional contribution of our study as focusing on OSS that is widely used allows us to more precisely understand the value created by OSS, rather than only measuring the  replacement  cost  for  all  OSS  (which  would  overestimate  the  true  value  since  many  OSS projects are not used in production code). However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n\nAdjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.  We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves.  Over  95%  percent  of  the  demand-side  value  is  generated  by  only  five  percent  of programmers, and those programmers contribute not only to a few widely used projects but to substantially more projects than the programmers that are engaged at the lower end of the value distribution.\n\nIn aggregate, our results show the substantial value that OSS contributes to the economy despite this value generally showing up as zero via direct measurement since prices equal zero and quantity is difficult to measure using public data alone. Our research lays the groundwork for future studies of not only OSS, but of all IT and its growing impact on the global economy.\n\nDocument 14: ## --- Figure 2 about here ---\n\nFigure 2 splits the OSS value estimates for each language by our inward facing (Census) and outward facing (BuiltWith) data sources.

Introduction\n\nIn 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that 'software is eating the world' (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that 'open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,' (Jacks, 2022). Other recent studies have come to similar conclusions showing that open source software  (OSS)  -  software  whose  source  code  is  publicly  available  for  inspection,  use,  and modification and is often created in a decentralized manner and distributed for free - appears in 96% of codebases (Synopsys 2023), and that some commercial software consists of up to 99.9% freely available OSS (Musseau et al., 2022). Although in its early days OSS frequently copied features from existing proprietary software, OSS today includes cutting edge technology in various fields including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, big data, and analytics.  However, despite the increasing importance of OSS to all software (and therefore to the entire economy), measuring its impact has been elusive. Traditionally, to measure the value created by a good or service,  economists  multiply  the  price  ( p )  times  the  quantity  sold  ( q ).  However,  in  OSS, p is generally zero since the source code is publicly available, and q is  unknown due to the limited number of restrictions around how the code may be copied and reused. For example, if a company downloads  a  piece  of  OSS  from  a  public  code  repository,  it  may  copy  it  thousands  of  times internally (legally) and then share it with suppliers or customers (also legally), so public download data is insufficient. Although some recent studies have sought to estimate the value of p (discussed below), data for estimating q has been unavailable or intractable for anything more than just a handful of OSS packages. Using newly collected data from multiple sources, the goal of this paper is to provide estimates for both p and q and to use those to shine light on the question: What is the value of open source software?\n\nUnderstanding the value of OSS is of critical importance not only due to the role it plays in the economy, but also due to it being one of the most successful and impactful modern examples of the centuries old economic concept of 'the commons' which run the risk of meeting the fate known as 'the tragedy of the commons.' This concept can trace its roots as far back as the 4 th -century BC philosopher Aristotle who wrote 'That which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care. Men pay most attention to what is their own and care less for what is common.'  (Aristotle,  1981).  William  Forster  Lloyd  (1833)  resurfaced  the  idea  in  modern economic thought by highlighting the example of shared tracts of land used for cattle grazing by\n\nmultiple cattle herders who each had an incentive to overuse the shared resource. Garrett Hardin (1968)  brought  the  concept  into  the  broader  zeitgeist  when  he  wrote  an  article  discussing  the problem entitled 'The Tragedy of the Commons.' Building on this work, Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for her research highlighting paths to avoiding the tragedy of the commons through community coordination efforts that did not necessitate government enforced laws to manage and guard the commons (Ostrom 1990). The parallels between shared grazing lands and shared digital infrastructure are palpable - the availability of communal grass to feed cattle, and in turn feed people, was critical to the agrarian economy, and the ability to not have to recreate code that someone else has already written is critical to the modern economy. Further, in both contexts, despite knowing grass and code are critical inputs to the economy, measuring their actual value is difficult. And, as the renowned mathematician and physicist Lord Kelvin is believed to have said, 'If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.' And if you cannot improve and maintain it, such common goods may crumble under the weight of their own success as they are overused, but underinvested in (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021). Therefore, measuring the value OSS creates is crucial to the future health of the digital economy, and the rest of the economy that is built on top of it.\n\nImportantly, recent studies have attempted to address these measurement issues but fall short of capturing both the breadth and depth of OSS usage - a gap we seek to fill with this paper. For example, researchers have attempted to gain breadth by using novel methodologies to estimate the labor replacement value of the current corpus of OSS created in the United States at $38 billion in 2019 (Robbins et al., 2021) and that created in the European Union at €1 billion (Blind et al., 2021) by imputing the labor costs that it would have taken to rewrite existing OSS. Such efforts do a very good job at estimating what it would cost to replace all existing OSS if it disappeared tomorrow. However, the resultant estimates rely on two important assumptions. First, that all OSS is equally valuable from a usage standpoint, and second that the concept of OSS would still exist, and society would just need to rewrite the code once, thus addressing the aforementioned problem of a missing value for p , but not addressing the missing value of q . In a world where OSS did not exist at all, then each piece of OSS software would not need to be rewritten just once, but instead would need to be rewritten by every firm that used the software (assuming the firm could freely share the software within its boundaries). Other research (Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; MurcianoGoroff, Zhuo, and Greenstein, 2021) has gone deeper into this hypothetical, albeit in a narrow\n\nmanner, by only focusing on web servers (which are public facing on the Internet and can therefore be readily measured). Using different methods, both studies measure q for this one type of software and impute p by using a goods replacement value approach based on the prices for closed-source alternatives offered by firms. With data from the United States the resulting estimates show a value of  $2  billion  for  the  OSS  Apache  Web  Server  in  2012  (Greenstein  and  Nagle,  2014)  and  a combined value of $4.5 billion for Apache and the increasingly popular OSS web server nginx in 2018 (Murciano-Goroff, et al., 2021). However, although web servers are an important part of the OSS  ecosystem,  they  constitute  a  small  portion  of  it.  We  seek  to  build  upon  the  important contributions this existing research has made in an attempt to go both broad and deep to create a more complete measure of the value of OSS.\n\nTo consider the value of OSS in both a broad and deep manner, we use data from two primary sources that allow us to gain insights into the OSS used at tens of thousands of firms across the world. The first is the 'Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries' (Nagle et al., 2022). The Census II project utilized partnerships with multiple software composition analysis (SCA) firms to create various lists of the most widely used OSS. SCAs are hired to scan the codebases of a company to ensure they are not violating any OSS licenses and, as a byproduct, track all the OSS code used by their customers and the products they build. The Census II project aggregated data from multiple SCAs to build a dataset of OSS usage at tens of thousands of firms based  on  millions  of  data  points  (observations  of  OSS  usage).  The  second  data  source  is  the BuiltWith dataset, from which we leverage scans of nearly nine million websites to identify the underlying technology deployed by these websites, including OSS libraries. The BuiltWith data has been used in multiple academic studies (DeStefano &amp; Timmis 2023, Dushnitsky &amp; Stroube 2021, Koning et al.. 2022), but to our knowledge this is the first one to focus on OSS usage. The Census II data and the BuiltWith data are complementary as the former focuses on OSS that is built  into  the  software  a  company  sells,  while  the  latter  focuses  on  OSS  that  is  built  into  a company's website, thus reducing the chances of double-counting observations across the datasets. In aggregate, these two datasets combined create the most complete measurement of OSS usage ( q ) to date. Further, by focusing on OSS that is widely deployed and used by firms, rather than considering all the projects that exist in an OSS repository, we enhance the methodologies of prior studies by reducing the likelihood of measurement error stemming from projects that are posted as publicly available OSS but are not actually used in any practical manner. Not accounting for this\n\nmeasurement error would lead to overestimation of the actual value of OSS as projects that are widely used would be valued in the same way as projects that are not used at all.\n\nTo estimate p ,  we  follow  the  literature  discussed  above  and  use  the  labor  replacement value. First, we calculate the labor cost it would take an individual firm to recreate a given OSS package by measuring the number of lines of code within the package and then applying the Constructive Cost Model II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) - also known as COCOMO II to estimate the number of person-hours it would take to write the code from scratch. We then utilize global wage data from Salary Expert to get an accurate estimate of the labor costs a firm would incur if this piece of OSS did not exist. These costs can be combined with the q values from above at the OSS package level to estimate the combined value of all OSS from both the supply and demand sides.\n\nWe find a value ranging from $1.22 billion to $6.22 billion if we were to decide as a society to recreate all widely used OSS on the supply side. However, considering the actual usage of OSS leads to a demand-side value that is orders of magnitude larger and ranges from $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion, if each firm who used an OSS package had to recreate it from scratch (e.g., the concept of OSS did not exist). We document substantial heterogeneity of the value of OSS by programming  language  and  internal  vs  outward-facing  programming  efforts.  Further,  we  find considerable  heterogeneity  in  value  contributions  by  programmers  as  5%  of  programmers  are responsible for more than 90% of the value created on the supply- and demand- side. The data we use is arguably the most comprehensive source of data to measure the value created by firm usage of OSS at this time. However, as for any project, the evidence is not complete and we argue that we underestimate the value since our data, e.g., does not include operating systems, which are a substantial omitted category of OSS.\n\nThis study makes four important contributions to the academic literature, practitioners, and policy makers. First, it provides the most complete estimate of the value of widely used OSS to date  by  accounting  for  not  only  the  supply-side  of  OSS  (price  to  create  it),  but  also  for  the usage\/demand-side at a scale that has not been done before. While prior estimates of the value of OSS only went either broad (estimating the supply-side costs of a large swath of OSS) or deep (estimating the value created by one particular type of OSS), this study does both by using unique datasets that allow for a better understanding of the breadth and depth of OSS usage. Further, rather than measuring the value of all OSS, this study focuses on the value of OSS that is used by firms\n\nto create its products and websites, limiting the measurement error occurring in studies that are unable to account for which OSS is actually used in production. This contribution builds upon, and extends, important research (e.g., Blind et al., 2021; Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021; Robbins et al., 2021) that has sought to identify the value of this vital resource that contributes a great deal to the modern economy despite the difficulties measuring this contribution. In  doing  so,  it  adds  insights  to  a  long-running  discussion  related  to  the  impact  of  information technology (IT) on productivity (Brynjolfsson, 1993; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 1996; Nagle, 2019a; Solow, 1987) known as the 'productivity paradox' where IT investments can have limited impact on productivity statistics. This debate has continued into the emerging context of AI (Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson, 2018). Our work contributes to this conversation by highlighting a massive societal level cost-savings (and hence productivity enhancement) that is created by the existence of OSS.\n\nSecond, our research contributes methodological advances to the study of intangible capital by highlighting novel sources of data related to investments in OSS. Prior research has shown that intangible capital plays an increasingly important role in economic growth (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel,  2009)  and  firm  value  (Peters  and  Taylor,  2017),  but  it  often  goes  unmeasured  or misattributed (Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou, 2014). Further, we demonstrate how these data sources can be used to understand the true investments in software that a firm makes, and that which they would have to make if OSS did not exist.  This  is  valuable  as  investments  in  software  are  an increasingly important type of intangible capital that is driving innovation (Branstetter, Drev, and Kwon, 2019) and performance (Krishnan et al., 2000).\n\nThird, our results help highlight for firms and managers the importance of OSS to their production, and ideally add weight to arguments that users of OSS should not just free ride but also contribute to the creation and maintenance of OSS (e.g., Henkel, 2008; Nagle, 2018). Such contributions are a fraction of the costs that firms would incur if OSS did not exist and the active participation of OSS users in helping maintain the OSS they use is critical to the health and future well-being of the OSS ecosystem (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021; Zhang et al., 2019).\n\nFourth,  and  finally,  our  study  helps  inform  policymakers  who  have  recently  started  to understand  the  growing  importance  of  OSS  to  the  economy  and  taken  actions  to  support  the ecosystem (European Commission, 2020; Executive Order No. 14028, 2021). However, most of these efforts are related to securing the existing OSS ecosystem, which is quite important, but do\n\nnot go as far as supporting the creation of new OSS. Our results help shine light on the importance of OSS to the overall economy and add weight to calls for more societal support of this critical resource. Our results further show that the majority of the value created by OSS is created by a small  number  of  contributors.  Although  it  has  long  been  known  that  a  small  number  of  OSS contributors do most of the work, we add new insights that show this is even more true for the value creation of widely-used OSS projects and that societal support for these individuals is critical to the future success of OSS, and in turn, the economy.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Introduction\n\nIn 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that 'software is eating the world' (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that 'open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,' (Jacks, 2022). Other recent studies have come to similar conclusions showing that open source software  (OSS)  -  software  whose  source  code  is  publicly  available  for  inspection,  use,  and modification and is often created in a decentralized manner and distributed for free - appears in 96% of codebases (Synopsys 2023), and that some commercial software consists of up to 99.9% freely available OSS (Musseau et al., 2022). Although in its early days OSS frequently copied features from existing proprietary software, OSS today includes cutting edge technology in various fields including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, big data, and analytics.  However, despite the increasing importance of OSS to all software (and therefore to the entire economy), measuring its impact has been elusive. Traditionally, to measure the value created by a good or service,  economists  multiply  the  price  ( p )  times  the  quantity  sold  ( q ).  However,  in  OSS, p is generally zero since the source code is publicly available, and q is  unknown due to the limited number of restrictions around how the code may be copied and reused. For example, if a company downloads  a  piece  of  OSS  from  a  public  code  repository,  it  may  copy  it  thousands  of  times internally (legally) and then share it with suppliers or customers (also legally), so public download data is insufficient. Although some recent studies have sought to estimate the value of p (discussed below), data for estimating q has been unavailable or intractable for anything more than just a handful of OSS packages. Using newly collected data from multiple sources, the goal of this paper is to provide estimates for both p and q and to use those to shine light on the question: What is the value of open source software?\n\nUnderstanding the value of OSS is of critical importance not only due to the role it plays in the economy, but also due to it being one of the most successful and impactful modern examples of the centuries old economic concept of 'the commons' which run the risk of meeting the fate known as 'the tragedy of the commons.' This concept can trace its roots as far back as the 4 th -century BC philosopher Aristotle who wrote 'That which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care. Men pay most attention to what is their own and care less for what is common.'  (Aristotle,  1981).  William  Forster  Lloyd  (1833)  resurfaced  the  idea  in  modern economic thought by highlighting the example of shared tracts of land used for cattle grazing by\n\nmultiple cattle herders who each had an incentive to overuse the shared resource. Garrett Hardin (1968)  brought  the  concept  into  the  broader  zeitgeist  when  he  wrote  an  article  discussing  the problem entitled 'The Tragedy of the Commons.' Building on this work, Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for her research highlighting paths to avoiding the tragedy of the commons through community coordination efforts that did not necessitate government enforced laws to manage and guard the commons (Ostrom 1990). The parallels between shared grazing lands and shared digital infrastructure are palpable - the availability of communal grass to feed cattle, and in turn feed people, was critical to the agrarian economy, and the ability to not have to recreate code that someone else has already written is critical to the modern economy. Further, in both contexts, despite knowing grass and code are critical inputs to the economy, measuring their actual value is difficult. And, as the renowned mathematician and physicist Lord Kelvin is believed to have said, 'If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.' And if you cannot improve and maintain it, such common goods may crumble under the weight of their own success as they are overused, but underinvested in (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021). Therefore, measuring the value OSS creates is crucial to the future health of the digital economy, and the rest of the economy that is built on top of it.\n\nImportantly, recent studies have attempted to address these measurement issues but fall short of capturing both the breadth and depth of OSS usage - a gap we seek to fill with this paper. For example, researchers have attempted to gain breadth by using novel methodologies to estimate the labor replacement value of the current corpus of OSS created in the United States at $38 billion in 2019 (Robbins et al., 2021) and that created in the European Union at €1 billion (Blind et al., 2021) by imputing the labor costs that it would have taken to rewrite existing OSS. Such efforts do a very good job at estimating what it would cost to replace all existing OSS if it disappeared tomorrow. However, the resultant estimates rely on two important assumptions. First, that all OSS is equally valuable from a usage standpoint, and second that the concept of OSS would still exist, and society would just need to rewrite the code once, thus addressing the aforementioned problem of a missing value for p , but not addressing the missing value of q . In a world where OSS did not exist at all, then each piece of OSS software would not need to be rewritten just once, but instead would need to be rewritten by every firm that used the software (assuming the firm could freely share the software within its boundaries). Other research (Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; MurcianoGoroff, Zhuo, and Greenstein, 2021) has gone deeper into this hypothetical, albeit in a narrow\n\nmanner, by only focusing on web servers (which are public facing on the Internet and can therefore be readily measured). Using different methods, both studies measure q for this one type of software and impute p by using a goods replacement value approach based on the prices for closed-source alternatives offered by firms. With data from the United States the resulting estimates show a value of  $2  billion  for  the  OSS  Apache  Web  Server  in  2012  (Greenstein  and  Nagle,  2014)  and  a combined value of $4.5 billion for Apache and the increasingly popular OSS web server nginx in 2018 (Murciano-Goroff, et al., 2021). However, although web servers are an important part of the OSS  ecosystem,  they  constitute  a  small  portion  of  it.  We  seek  to  build  upon  the  important contributions this existing research has made in an attempt to go both broad and deep to create a more complete measure of the value of OSS.\n\nTo consider the value of OSS in both a broad and deep manner, we use data from two primary sources that allow us to gain insights into the OSS used at tens of thousands of firms across the world. The first is the 'Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries' (Nagle et al., 2022). The Census II project utilized partnerships with multiple software composition analysis (SCA) firms to create various lists of the most widely used OSS. SCAs are hired to scan the codebases of a company to ensure they are not violating any OSS licenses and, as a byproduct, track all the OSS code used by their customers and the products they build. The Census II project aggregated data from multiple SCAs to build a dataset of OSS usage at tens of thousands of firms based  on  millions  of  data  points  (observations  of  OSS  usage).  The  second  data  source  is  the BuiltWith dataset, from which we leverage scans of nearly nine million websites to identify the underlying technology deployed by these websites, including OSS libraries. The BuiltWith data has been used in multiple academic studies (DeStefano &amp; Timmis 2023, Dushnitsky &amp; Stroube 2021, Koning et al.. 2022), but to our knowledge this is the first one to focus on OSS usage. The Census II data and the BuiltWith data are complementary as the former focuses on OSS that is built  into  the  software  a  company  sells,  while  the  latter  focuses  on  OSS  that  is  built  into  a company's website, thus reducing the chances of double-counting observations across the datasets. In aggregate, these two datasets combined create the most complete measurement of OSS usage ( q ) to date. Further, by focusing on OSS that is widely deployed and used by firms, rather than considering all the projects that exist in an OSS repository, we enhance the methodologies of prior studies by reducing the likelihood of measurement error stemming from projects that are posted as publicly available OSS but are not actually used in any practical manner. Not accounting for this\n\nmeasurement error would lead to overestimation of the actual value of OSS as projects that are widely used would be valued in the same way as projects that are not used at all.\n\nTo estimate p ,  we  follow  the  literature  discussed  above  and  use  the  labor  replacement value. First, we calculate the labor cost it would take an individual firm to recreate a given OSS package by measuring the number of lines of code within the package and then applying the Constructive Cost Model II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) - also known as COCOMO II to estimate the number of person-hours it would take to write the code from scratch. We then utilize global wage data from Salary Expert to get an accurate estimate of the labor costs a firm would incur if this piece of OSS did not exist. These costs can be combined with the q values from above at the OSS package level to estimate the combined value of all OSS from both the supply and demand sides.\n\nWe find a value ranging from $1.22 billion to $6.22 billion if we were to decide as a society to recreate all widely used OSS on the supply side. However, considering the actual usage of OSS leads to a demand-side value that is orders of magnitude larger and ranges from $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion, if each firm who used an OSS package had to recreate it from scratch (e.g., the concept of OSS did not exist).

Section 2 describes the empirical setting and data. Section 3 discusses the methods including measurement challenges. In section 4, we estimate the value of open source software. Section 5 concludes.\n\nDocument 16: ## 5. Conclusion\n\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith. We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average value and distributed it across industries.\n\nIn this study we estimate the value of widely-used open source software globally with two unique datasets: the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data. We are able to estimate not only the supply side value of existing code (e.g., the cost it would take to rewrite each piece of widely-used OSS once) but also the demand side value for the private economy (e.g., the cost it would take for each company that uses a piece of OSS to rewrite it). While we do not focus on the long tail of OSS, we consider this an additional contribution of our study as focusing on OSS that is widely used allows us to more precisely understand the value created by OSS, rather than only measuring the  replacement  cost  for  all  OSS  (which  would  overestimate  the  true  value  since  many  OSS projects are not used in production code). However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n\nAdjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.  We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves.  Over  95%  percent  of  the  demand-side  value  is  generated  by  only  five  percent  of programmers, and those programmers contribute not only to a few widely used projects but to substantially more projects than the programmers that are engaged at the lower end of the value distribution.\n\nIn aggregate, our results show the substantial value that OSS contributes to the economy despite this value generally showing up as zero via direct measurement since prices equal zero and quantity is difficult to measure using public data alone. Our research lays the groundwork for future studies of not only OSS, but of all IT and its growing impact on the global economy.\n\nDocument 5: ## Abstract\n\nThe  value  of  a  non-pecuniary  (free)  product  is  inherently  difficult  to  assess.  A  pervasive example is open source software (OSS), a global public good that plays a vital role in the economy and is foundational for most technology we use today. However, it is difficult to measure the value of OSS due to its non-pecuniary nature and lack of centralized usage tracking. Therefore, OSS remains largely unaccounted for in economic measures. Although prior studies have estimated the supply-side costs to recreate this software, a lack of data has hampered estimating the much larger demand-side (usage) value created by OSS. Therefore, to understand the complete economic and social value of widely-used OSS, we leverage unique global data from two complementary sources capturing  OSS  usage  by  millions  of  global  firms.  We  first  estimate  the  supply-side  value  by calculating the cost to recreate the most widely used OSS once. We then calculate the demandside value based on a replacement value for each firm that uses the software and would need to build it internally if OSS did not exist. We estimate the supply-side value of widely-used OSS is $4.15 billion, but that the demand-side value is much larger at $8.8 trillion. We find that firms would need to spend 3.5 times more on software than they currently do if OSS did not exist. The top six programming languages in our sample comprise 84% of the demand-side value of OSS. Further, 96% of the demand-side value is created by only 5% of OSS developers.\n\nJEL Classification:\n\nH4; O3; J0\n\nKeywords: Open-source software, global public good\n\nAcknowledgement: The authors are grateful for  financial  and  administrative  support  from  the Linux  Foundation  without  which  the  data  from  the  Census  would  not  have  otherwise  been available.

Empirical Setting and Data\n\nAlthough the concept of free and open software has existed since the 1950's, it became more popular in the 1980's due to the efforts of Richard Stallman and his launch of the GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation (Maracke, 2019). However, it was in the 1990's that OSS took off after Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel, a now widely adopted OSS operating system (Tozzi, 2016). Today, OSS is considered a key building block of the digital economy and is widely used by software developers in everything from phones to cars to refrigerators to cutting-edge AI (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021).\n\nWe use two complementary main data sources to estimate the value of OSS. The first is the Census and is inward facing. It allows us to identify OSS code that goes into products that firms create. The second dataset is BuiltWith and is outward facing, allowing us to identify OSS code  that  consumers  directly  interact  with  through  firm  websites.  Since  the  raw  data  in  both datasets only contains package names, version numbers, and package manager names, and does not  contain  any  source  code  related  information,  we  first  obtain  the  publicly  accessible  code repository for each package which includes package-level information including the lines of code and  the  programming  languages  used.  One  may  worry  about  double-counting  for  the  value calculations as a result of using two separate datasets. However, the overlap of both the Census and  the  BuiltWith  sample  is  very  small:  there  are  only  18  packages  found  in  both  datasets. Moreover, it is unlikely that double counting is a concern as the two datasets capture different dimensions of OSS usage: the Census captures packaged software whose usage is inward-facing while BuiltWith captures usage in websites that are outward-facing. Finally, as a supplementary\n\ndataset, we use GHTorrent, a detailed history of OSS-related activity on GitHub, the most popular OSS hosting platform and a commonly used data source for studies of OSS (e.g., Burton et al, 2017; Conti, Peukert, and Roche, 2023; Fackler, Hofmann, and Laurentsyeva, 2023; Kim, 2020; Tang, Wang, &amp; Tong, 2023). This detailed historical data allows us to go deeper into how the value  of  OSS  is  created  by  better  understanding  the  dispersion  of  the  contributions  across individual OSS developers. We describe the details of all three data sources and their preparation for estimation below.\n\nCensus. The  Census  II  of  Free  and  Open  Source  Software  (here:  Census)  was  jointly undertaken by the Linux Foundation and the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (Nagle et  al.,  2022). 1 The  Census  was  created  via  the  aggregation  of  data  from  three  major  software composition analysis (SCA) firms with thousands of clients across the globe. SCAs are hired to scan the codebase of a client and gather the OSS usage embedded in their proprietary software to ensure they are not violating any OSS license agreements.  Frequently this takes place as part of 2 the due diligence process related to mergers and acquisitions. Unlike other OSS demand measures available from public sources such as package download counts and code changes, the way this data was collected ensures that we observe the precise amount and type of internal OSS usage of the firms. In addition, it allows us to trace the dependencies each package relies on, so that we can observe the indirect OSS usage that is commonly hidden and difficult to obtain.  The result is over 3 2.7 million observations of OSS packages being used within products created by the SCA client firms for the calendar year 2020 (January 1 to December 31, 2020). 4\n\nThe Census project standardized package names based on the naming system of libraries.io -  a  widely  used  site  maintained  by  Tidelift  that  organizes  information  about  more  than  eight million open source packages. The Census focused on the top 2,000 packages based on usage\n\n1 The precise methodologies for the data collection and aggregation are detailed in the Census report by Nagle et al (2022).\n\n2 OSS usage licenses vary a great deal and while some licenses are very open and allow the code to be reused in any manner, including within proprietary code that will be made available for sale at a non-zero price, other licenses restrict reuse to only be allowed if the resultant code is released under the same OSS license (known as copyleft). A detailed discussion of OSS licenses can be found in Lerner and Tirole (2005) and Almeida et al (2017).\n\n3 Indirect OSS usage is captured by dependency analysis and is necessary to accurately measure the full breadth of the OSS a firm relies on. For example, if a firm's proprietary code calls OSS package A, but package A, in turn, calls package B, then only looking at the direct calls would miss that package B was a required building block for the firm's proprietary code.\n\n4 The Census defines an OSS package as 'a unit of software that can be installed and managed by a package manager,' and  defines  a  package  manager  as  'software  that  automates  the  process  of  installing  and  otherwise  managing packages' (Nagle et al, 2022).\n\nreported from the three of the most prominent SCA vendors to identify the most widely used OSS rather  than  the  long-tail  of  the  usage  distribution.  This  led  to  packages  with  less  than  five observations  of  usage  being  dropped.  Since  packages  written  in  the  JavaScript  programming language, and usually hosted on the Node Package Manager (NPM), are generally smaller (fewer lines  of  code)  than  packages  in  other  languages  and  therefore  frequently  have  higher  usage numbers (since developers must include many small packages instead of a few large packages), the Census separately selected the top 1,000 NPM packages and the top 1,000 non-NPM hosted packages.\n\nThis final dataset covers 70% of the total usage of OSS observed in the raw data of the census.   For  each  of  these  2,000  OSS  packages  in  the  Census,  we  identified  the  raw  code 5 maintained on GitHub, the most widely used platform for hosting OSS.  We first attempted to 6 obtain the GitHub repository uniform resource locator (URL) for each package from libraries.io. We were able to match 1,657 packages to repositories via this initial method.  For URLs without 7 a  matching  repository,  we  performed  Google  searches  loosely  following  the  method  in  Singh (2020). More specifically, for each unmatched package, we used the Google API to search for the package name and 'GitHub Repository' and treated the first GitHub repository URL in the results as  its  best  matched  GitHub  URL.   This  resulted  in  an  additional  174  packages  matched  to  a 8 repository. Finally, we manually searched for URLs for the remaining 169 packages to identify the relevant repository. This entire process resulted in matching 1,840 out of the 2,000 Census packages to a code repository with the raw source code for the package. The unmatched packages were determined to have been either removed from GitHub or became proprietary (and thus the original source code was no longer available) and hence, the manual search allowed us to drop\n\n5 The packages that made up the remaining 30% of the full Census data in the long-tail usage distribution were not shared in the final report and therefore cannot be included in our analysis.\n\n6 GitHub  is  a  hosting  and  collaboration  platform  that  contributors  can  use  to  coordinate  the  development  and distribution of OSS projects. Founded in 2008, GitHub has become the largest hub for OSS development in the world. In January 2023, GitHub had more than 370 million repositories and over 100 million developers. In addition to personal users, a wide range of private firms actively use the GitHub platform, including Microsoft (which bought GitHub in 2018), Facebook, Google, and numerous other small and large firms.\n\n7 We attempted to access all repository URLs obtained as a sanity check to ensure they are in working condition. For those we could not access on GitHub, we manually found the correct URLs.\n\n8 As a robustness check, we randomly selected 50 package-repository matches derived from the Google Search method and we checked them by hand. All matches were manually confirmed to be correct providing additional support for the automated matching method.\n\nthese 160 unmatched packages (less than 8% of the Census sample of 2,000) with high confidence from our analysis.\n\nBuiltWith. The BuiltWith data contains scans of all public websites across the globe and identifies the technologies they use. Unlike the inward facing Census data which focus on the usage of OSS, the BuiltWith data scan for the use of both proprietary and OSS in firm websites without explicit differentiation. To separate OSS from proprietary software in BuiltWith, we turn to the subset of all open source web development software in the technology category that includes \"JavaScript and its libraries,\" which generates 778 observations corresponding to the NPM OSS category  in  the  Census  data.  There  are  two  reasons  for  this  sampling  choice.  First,  this  given category is constructed by BuiltWith and we use it as a proxy for OSS to separate it from pecuniary software.  Second,  JavaScript,  one  of  the  core  technologies  for  building  websites,  is  the  most popular programming language by usage on GitHub (GitHub, 2022) and thus enables us to capture the most important OSS from the demand side perspective. The scans include 8.8 million unique websites and 72.8 million corresponding observations of OSS usage from January 1 to November 16, 2020. Further, to ensure that we measure the value of OSS usage generated by the private sector,  we  match  the  adopting  domains  of  the  JavaScript-related  OSS  from  BuiltWith  with company websites recorded in Orbis, Compustat, and PitchBook, three commonly used databases of corporate activity that capture registered businesses across the world. Performing this match ensures that OSS used by non-commercial websites (e.g., an individual person's personal website) is excluded in our analysis. This results in a match-rate of 38.6%, which corresponds to around 3.4 million websites of distinct firms.\n\nFor the BuiltWith data, we cannot employ the first method we use for the Census (using libraries.io to help identify the repository URL) since only the technology names associated with the  packages  were  provided  by  BuiltWith,  and  other  information  (e.g.,  package  and  package manager  names)  is  not  included. 9 Hence,  we  start  by  performing  the  Google  Search  method mentioned above which results in a match of 695 packages to repositories. We then manually searched the Github URLs for 83 of the remaining unmatched packages, resulting in an addition of 46 packages. In total, for the BuiltWith data we were able to identify 741 out of 778 package-\n\n9 Since the package and package manager names are missing, a precise match using libraries.io was not feasible. Technology names are product names intended for customers and can be less technical and precise than the package names for internal development purposes. Thus, using technology names in a libraries.io search could cause significant ambiguity.\n\nrepository matches. As with the Census data, the remaining 37 unmatched packages (less than 5%) are dropped from our analysis because they had been deleted from GitHub.\n\nGHTorrent database. To obtain measures of the dispersion of the OSS value creation, we utilize  the  GHTorrent  database,  which  contains  the  entire  activity  history  on  GitHub  using GitHub's Representational State Transfer (REST) application programming interface (API). We leveraged  its  records  of  GitHub  repositories,  developer-level  commits,  and  developer  public profile information to estimate the contribution of each developer. We narrowed the sample for our developer contribution analysis in two steps. First, we winnowed the GitHub repositories and their  commits  from  GHTorrent  based  on  the  repository  URLs  of  our  joint  Census-BuiltWith sample. 10 Second, we focus on human contributions to OSS by removing approximately eight thousand (12%) GitHub contributors that we considered to be robots. 11 The final sample contains around sixty thousand developers and 2.3 million commits.\n\nTo prepare these three datasets for estimation, we first identified the number of lines of code and the programming languages used for each package using the OSS packages pygount (to count  the  number  of  lines  of  code)  and  linguist  (to  identify  programming  languages). 12 We categorize each distinct language into one of three different buckets moving from more likely human-written to more likely machine-written (see Table A1). Bucket 1 contains programming and markup languages (which are most likely to be human-written), bucket 3 contains data (most likely to be machine-written), and bucket 2 contains anything in between, such as config files and batch processing (which are sometimes human-written and sometimes machine-written, but it is difficult to tell based purely on looking at the code). 13 For our primary estimation we only use bucket 1 while providing robustness checks for buckets 2 and 3 in the Appendix, and thus our results represent a lower bound. Finally, for some analyses we dig deeper and show the top 5 programming languages (as classified by GitHub, 2022 for the year 2020; the year our data is from). The top 5 programming languages contain C (including C# and C++), Java, JavaScript,\n\n10 The match rate is over 96%, with the unmatched repositories accounting for only 0.15% of our calculated OSS demand value discussed below.\n\n11 The filtering is based on the 'fake user' classification by GHTorrent, as well as any usernames containing words 'bot' or 'robot', surrounded by special characters. This method is more conservative than other methods of bot detection  like  that  used  in  the  GitHub  Innovation  Graph  (https:\/\/innovationgraph.github.com\/),  which  rely  on  a monthly commit frequency threshold.\n\n12 https:\/\/pypi.org\/project\/pygount\/ and https:\/\/github.com\/github-linguist\/linguist\n\n13 Note that our focus is the cost to recreate OSS code written by humans, not robots. However, directly removing all OSS contributions from robot accounts is infeasible here, because we cannot observe the exact lines of code written by the robot accounts on GitHub.\n\nPython, and Typescript.

Panel A and Panel B focus on the supply and demand side estimation for the Census. We obtain a similar pattern that has been established already in the aggregate when pooling both data sources (Figure 1) albeit the impact of JavaScript is substantially lower.  On  the  supply  side  of  the  Census  in  Panel  A,  Java  has  the  second-highest  value  while JavaScript  code  from  the  Census  contributes  to  a  substantially  lower  value  to  the  aggregate. Similarly, the supply side values of C, Python, and Typescript are mainly driven by the Census. From the demand side Panel B we find that Go is the most popular language for inward facing code while all other languages appear to be negligible in relative terms.\n\nFigure 2, Panel C and Panel D show the supply and demand side values for the BuiltWith dataset. The supply side value in Panel C clearly indicates that the value from the BuiltWith sample is driven by JavaScript code, which is a good sanity check since we focused on JavaScript packages to proxy for OSS in the BuiltWith sample, as discussed above. The second highest value is created by TypeScript which is reassuring since it is a superset of JavaScript. Panel D shows a similar pattern  on  the  usage  side  where  most  of  the  value  arises  from  JavaScript  while  TypeScript  is trailing at the second spot as well. The other languages contribute only marginal amounts to the supply and demand side values. Overall, these findings are broadly consistent with the main use cases of the various languages (web programming vs. application programming) and an idea that languages through which value are generated are not necessarily identical to languages that are used by the general public.\n\n--- Figure 3 about here ---\n\nFigure 3 shows the demand-side value of OSS across industries by NAICS 2-digit codes using the BuiltWith online data. 20 This can be interpreted as the value each of these industries receive because OSS exists. The industry with the highest usage value of around $43 billion is 'Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.' 'Retail Trade' as well as 'Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services' make up another large part of the demand-side externally facing value of OSS with $36 billion and $35 billion, respectively. In contrast, industries that constitute just a small portion of the value are 'Mining, Quarrying, and Oil  and  Gas  Extraction',  'Utilities',  'Agriculture,  Forestry,  Fishing,  and  Hunting.'  The  latter industries are classical non-service sector industries and as such software is expected to play less of a role there.\n\nDocument 13: ## --- Figure 1 about here ---\n\nFigure 1 shows the heterogeneity of the value of OSS across the top programming languages. Panel A shows the supply side value with the labor value being displayed on the vertical axis. We find that OSS packages created in Go have the highest value with $803 million in value that would have to be created from scratch if the OSS packages did not exist. Go is closely followed by JavaScript  and  Java  with  $758  million  and  $658  million,  respectively.  The  value  of  C  and Typescript is $406 million and $317 million, respectively, while Python has the lowest value of the top languages with around $55 million. JavaScript is not only the top language on GitHub since at least 2014 (GitHub, 2022) it is also the language with one of the highest values in our data. In contrast, Python became more popular over time moving up from the number four spot to the number two language being used in 2020 across all OSS packages on GitHub, while it is in the last spot of our top languages.\n\nPanel B shows the demand side value across the top programming languages. Based on usage generated value, Go is more than four times the value of the next language, JavaScript.\n\nTypescript (a language that extends JavaScript) has seen immense growth rising from the tenth spot of the top 10 languages in 2017 to the fourth spot in 2020 which is also reflected in our data with  Typescript  being  the  third  most  important  language  on  the  demand  side.  The  two  web languages are followed by C and far behind are Java, and Python.\n\nDocument 16: ## 5. Conclusion\n\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith. We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average value and distributed it across industries.\n\nIn this study we estimate the value of widely-used open source software globally with two unique datasets: the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data. We are able to estimate not only the supply side value of existing code (e.g., the cost it would take to rewrite each piece of widely-used OSS once) but also the demand side value for the private economy (e.g., the cost it would take for each company that uses a piece of OSS to rewrite it). While we do not focus on the long tail of OSS, we consider this an additional contribution of our study as focusing on OSS that is widely used allows us to more precisely understand the value created by OSS, rather than only measuring the  replacement  cost  for  all  OSS  (which  would  overestimate  the  true  value  since  many  OSS projects are not used in production code). However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n\nAdjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.  We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves.  Over  95%  percent  of  the  demand-side  value  is  generated  by  only  five  percent  of programmers, and those programmers contribute not only to a few widely used projects but to substantially more projects than the programmers that are engaged at the lower end of the value distribution.\n\nIn aggregate, our results show the substantial value that OSS contributes to the economy despite this value generally showing up as zero via direct measurement since prices equal zero and quantity is difficult to measure using public data alone. Our research lays the groundwork for future studies of not only OSS, but of all IT and its growing impact on the global economy.\n\nDocument 12: ## --- Table 1 about here ---\n\nTable  1  shows  descriptive  statistics  from  both  data  sets  separately.  The  inward-facing Census  (Panel  A)  contains  just  over  261.7  million  lines  of  code  with  72%  of  the  lines  being attributable to the top programming languages. The average package includes 142 thousand lines of code with a slightly lower average of 113 thousand lines of code for the subset of top languages. When considering the demand (usage) side, we observe that the Census packages were used over 2.7 million times while 92% of this usage is attributable to the top languages. The average package was used 1,472.4 times with a higher usage of around 1,497.5 for the top  languages.  For  the outward-facing  BuiltWith  data  we  find  similar  patterns,  but  at  different  levels.  The  packages included from BuiltWith include over 82 million lines of code, 71% of which are attributable to the  top  programming  languages.  The  average  package  within  the  BuiltWith  sample  has  111 thousand  lines  of  code  with  a  lower  average  of  around  80  thousand  lines  of  code  for  the  top languages. This is because our BuiltWith data primarily consists of JavaScript-based packages, which are often smaller than packages written in other languages. BuiltWith packages were used over 142 thousand times where 99.97% were attributable to the top languages. Next, we used these raw observations to calculate the value of all OSS through the labor market approach and estimated the value created from the supply and demand side.\n\n--- Table 2 about here ---\n\nTable 2 shows the estimates for the value of OSS based on the firm-relevant joint Census and BuiltWith sample. All estimates in Table 2 are based only on software languages classified in bucket  1  from  Table  A1,  which  are  the  most  likely  to  be  written  by  a  human  rather  than  a machine. 19 The first column contains estimates with wages from a low income country (India), the global  average  wage,  and  a  high  income  country  (United  States  of  America),  respectively  (as described above). To reproduce all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the idea of OSS still exists, but all current OSS is deleted and needs to be coded from scratch), using programmers at the average developer wage from India, it would require an investment of $1.22 billion. In contrast, if we use the average developer wage from the United States, then reproducing all widely-used OSS would require  an  investment  of  $6.22  billion.  Using  a  pool  of  programmers  from  across  the  world, weighed based on the existing geographic contributions to OSS as discussed above, would lead to an investment somewhere in between the low and high-income country, $4.15 billion. It is useful to compare these numbers to those from similar studies to understand differences in valuing all OSS (prior studies) versus that which is widely used (our study). Robbins et al. (2021) and Blind et al. (2021) use a method similar to ours and estimate that the value of OSS created in the US is $38 billion in 2019 and that created in the EU is €1 billion in 2018. Wachs et al. (2022) show that roughly 50% of OSS contributions come from the US and EU combined. In aggregate, that would lead these studies to give a global value of OSS of $78 billion. Thus, our middle estimate of a supply-side value of $4.15 billion for only firm-oriented and widely used OSS is a credible lowerbound and highlights the higher estimations of the total of supply-side value of OSS when not considering whether or not a given OSS package is widely used. This further indicates that the supply-side value of the most widely used OSS is roughly 5.5% of the supply-side value of all OSS.\n\nThe second column in Table 2 contains the demand side estimates based on the labor market approach. We find that if firms had to recreate all OSS packages they used (e.g., OSS itself no longer existed and every firm that used an OSS package had to recreate it), then the entire cost would amount to between $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion using labor from the low wage or high wage country only, respectively. A pool of programmers across the globe could recreate all of OSS that is being widely used for a cost of approximately $8.80 trillion. Interpreting this number is\n\n19 Tables in the appendix show the equivalent values from Table 2 when including software language buckets 1 and 2 (Table A3) and all three software language buckets (Table A4).\n\nslightly more complicated but still feasible. According to a Statista (2023) report, global software revenue in 2020 (the same year as our data) was $531.7 billion. However, this represents a flow, not a stock, of software. Relying on government estimates that software fully depreciates over three years, we can do a back of the envelope calculation and consider the purchase value of the full stock of prepackaged software used in 2020 as the aggregate of that sold from 2018 to 2020, which is $1.54 trillion. Further, this represents only the expenditure on prepackaged software and does  not  include  custom  purchased  or  in-house  developed  software.  Here,  the  best  obtainable estimates of private-sector investment in software overall come from the United States National Income and Product Accounts data (NIPA 2023). In 2020, the national account data shows that in the  US,  private  firms  spent  $479.2  billion  on  software,  of  which  45%  ($215.5  billion)  was prepackaged. If we assume this is a consistent ratio for the rest of the world, then the total amount firms spent on software being used in 2020 was $3.4 trillion (= $1.54 trillion\/0.45). Combining this rough estimate with the demand side estimate of the value of OSS based on an average global wage ($8.8 trillion), this indicates firms would spend $12.2 trillion (=$3.4 trillion + $8.8 trillion), or three and a half times what they currently spend if they needed to pay in-house developers to write the OSS that they currently use for free.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"situational","seed_document_id":14,"situational_context":"A research analyst delves into the immense economic impact of open source software on various industries, seeking precise data from the Harvard Business School's OSS report for their upcoming presentation.","topic":"Others"}}

Can you explain how this method is used to estimate the value of OSS according to the Harvard Business School's OSS report?","reference_answer":"The goods-market valuation approach estimates the value of OSS by considering the costs if all commercial users of free OSS had to replace that software with pecuniary alternatives. It involves creating a basket of equivalent substitute proprietary goods priced on the open market as stand-ins for OSS products. This method assumes a fixed price to sell a good multiple times, which is usually lower than the total value estimated from recreating all packages on the labor side. The approach uses a basket of 20 OSS packages with proprietary substitutes and calculates the average COCOMO labor supply-side value and the average price for the basket to obtain the price of OSS for the goods market. The demand-side goods-market values range between $177 million and $244 million. The method emphasizes that the goods-market value is substantially smaller than the labor demand value since a firm can make a profit by producing the software once and selling it multiple times.","reference_context":"Document 21: ## Appendix A) Goods-Market Valuation Approach\n\nAs an alternate estimation method, instead of using the labor replacement cost, we use a goods replacement value approach. We identify several OSS packages that have similar closed-source, pecuniary alternatives and consider the costs if all commercial users of the free OSS had to replace that software with a pecuniary alternative (similar to the calculations Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) performed for web servers). We can then use this alternate value of p , combined with the q values from above to estimate a goods replacement value of OSS. This method builds on suggestions from Nordhaus (2006, p. 146) who says '…the price of market and nonmarket goods and services should be imputed on the basis of the comparable market goods and services.' We do not expect the estimates from the two methods to be similar. Quite the contrary, the value of those two methods varies substantially since the latter goods-market approach assumes a fixed price to sell a good multiple times and that fixed price is usually lower than the total value estimated from recreating all packages on the labor side. The differential between these estimates is  essentially the result of a firm stepping in to reproduce the missing OSS packages and then selling them for a pecuniary price rather than all firms needing to reproduce those packages from scratch themselves.\n\nWith the goods market approach, the thought experiment is still that we live in a world where OSS does not exist, but it has to be recreated via one firm that then charges a price for a good that is currently free. To value OSS via the goods market approach, we created a basket of equivalent substitute proprietary goods that are priced on the open market as a stand-in for an OSS product.  This  methodology  is  consistent  with  that  used  in  the  prior  literature  (Greenstein  and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021) although both of those studies only used a single good rather than a basket since they were focused on only one type of OSS (web servers). Since there is no readily available database for proprietary equivalents of OSS, we conduct a search based on subjective  perception  of  popularity  of  OSS  and  we  then  search  for  pecuniary,  closed-source substitutes for them. The resulting basket of 20 OSS packages with proprietary substitutes is a good representation of the diversity of OSS. The software ranges from media and design software to statistical analysis programs, to database management and web server software. 21\n\n21 Table A5 shows the basket of OSS and their proprietary equivalents that we used. To create this basket, we looked for proprietary software that had an OSS equivalent that was similar in its overall function and feature set, and sought to identify pairs of software that, in aggregate, captured a broad and representative set of the types of OSS that exist.\n\nBased on our OSS equivalent substitute proprietary goods basket we then obtain prices for each proprietary software equivalent and we calculated the COCOMO labor market supply-side value for each OSS product in the basket which we use as a proxy - for lack of the code from the proprietary software - for the COCOMO labor supply side value of the proprietary software (e.g., the cost it would take to pay a programmer to write that proprietary software from scratch). We then calculate the average COCOMO labor supply-side value of the basket, 𝑉 !,1#23.4 ,  and  the average price for the basket, 𝑃 !,1#23.4 . 22 Since, we know the labor market supply-side value of all OSS, 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; , we can setup the following equation and obtain the price of OSS, 𝑃 ! for the goodsmarket for all OSS via a simple scaling transformation:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nThis results in the following goods-market supply-side value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nWe can then obtain the equivalent demand-side goods-market values as follows:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nFrom the goods market side, we consider the equivalent price that a firm would charge if it produced all existing widely used OSS and then sold it as a product to customers.\n\nTable A6, column 3 shows that the value on the demand side ranges between $177 million and $244 million across the different buckets independent of the country of origin from which programmers are hired. Naturally, the goods-market value will be substantially smaller than the labor demand value since this imaginary firm will make a profit at a comparatively low price by producing the software once and then selling it to many customers. Further, while Greenstein and Nagle (2014) as well as Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) focus on one particular type of software only (web servers), we attempt to expand on their approach to many goods. However, the data limitations become a stronger constraint in this context which makes it inherently more difficult\n\n22 We obtained the average price of the goods-market proprietary basket by using a 3 years lifespan of software, i.e. 1\/(1-0.66), so the depreciation factor is 0.33. This is consistent with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules for depreciating software, which states 'If you can depreciate the cost of computer software, use the straight line method over a useful life of 36 months.' https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/publications\/p946#en\\_US\\_2022\\_publink1000107354.\n\nto  estimate  the  value  through  this  approach  while  requiring  substantially  more  assumptions. Instead of a pure goods-market approach, this requires assistance from the labor-market approach in terms of scaling for the estimate, which ultimately leads to a substantial underestimate of the value of OSS. Further, the pricing strategy of the proprietary software counterparts is sensitive to the  market  demand.  With  the  goods-market  approach  extending  to  multiple  goods,  the  strong implicit assumption is that the market demands for our basket software and our sample OSS are similar, so they lead to commensurate prices.\n\nAn alternative and even more simplified goods-market back-of-the-envelope calculation that does not account for lines of code and relies on no scaling from the labor market approach would simply be to multiply a price of a reference good with the usage. We can take the minimum, average, and maximum prices of the basket of proprietary goods as captured in the reference price vector p = (69.99, 1610.17, 5800) and simply multiply it with usage from the combined Census and BuiltWith sample (Table 1). Based on those imputed proprietary price assumptions, the goods market demand side value would range from $0.2 - $16.5 trillion (minimum price - maximum price)  with  the  mean  price  resulting  in  a  value  estimate  of  $4.5  trillion.  However,  while  this estimate creates slightly more variance than the labor market approach, it is inherently flawed by simply assuming that the imputed prices are identical for each open source product based on the reference price. We further think this very simple back-of-the-envelope is an orange to apples comparison since the goods in our basket are fully functional, stand-alone software packages, while the packages in the Census and BuiltWith datasets are comprised of application libraries, which are generally smaller than such stand-alone packages.\n\nGiven all the complexities and assumptions one has to make due to lack of data for a goodsmarket approach, we place stronger emphasis on the labor cost approach highlighted in the main body but we include this method here for completeness.\n\nDocument 9: ## 3.1 Labor market approach\n\nFor the labor market approach, we estimate the value of OSS by calculating the replacement value of a package. We ask how much it would cost to reproduce the package by hiring a programmer and paying them a competitive market wage. To estimate this supply-side value ( 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; ) , we take the complete list of OSS packages discussed above, and then count the lines of code in each unique\n\n14 In an alternative version, we use a mixture of a labor and goods market approach that is more closely aligned with Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff, et al (2021). However, applying this method in our setting requires numerous additional assumptions due to data constraints. For simplicity we call it the goods market approach for which we provide the details and statistics, as well as the limitations in Appendix A.\n\npackage. 15 For each unique package,  , we calculate the value and then sum over all these values i to obtain the total value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nIn this calculation, we implicitly do not incorporate any production externalities since we assume that there is no spillover knowledge from one package to the next that would lower the cost of programming. 16 This methodology is similar to that used by other papers that estimate the supply-side costs of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021).\n\nWe then calculate the demand-side value of OSS by incorporating the usage information ( Q) for each package:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nHere, we do not incorporate consumption externalities, i.e., we do not allow a benefit to arise for the general public when a package has been created and we further make sure that each firm is only replacing a package they use once, since a replaced package can be used within a firm as a club good (e.g., see Cornes and Sandler, 1996). The value 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost to rewrite all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the concept of OSS still exists, but all of these packages needed to be rewritten from scratch), while the value 𝑉 + \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost for each firm that uses one of these OSS packages to pay a developer to rewrite those packages (e.g., OSS itself no longer exists).\n\nFor both the supply and demand models, we obtain the dollar-value for each package ( 𝑃 ( ) via the Constructive Cost Model II, also abbreviated as COCOMO II (Boehm 1984, Boehm et al. 2009). The model has previously been used by the United States Department of Defense to estimate software project costs as well as in prior research estimating the value of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021). It is a highly flexible model that allows us to create non-linear transformations of lines of code to dollar-values. It uses the following modelling equation:\n\n15 We use only the pure lines of code excluding documentation lines and empty lines. Hence, we underestimate the true value of recreating each package.\n\n16 Similar to a representative agent model (e.g. see Williamson 2006), one may think of each package being reproduced by separate programmers who are identical replicas of each other (and therefore have the same skill level, but do not become more efficient via learning).\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n( (\n\nwhere 𝐿 represents the lines of codes in thousands and E the effort in person-month units for each project  . Consistent with Blind et al. (2021), we use the default parameter values for i 𝛼 , 𝛽 and 𝜂. The parameters 𝛼 𝛽 , are non-linear adjustment factors set to 2.94, and 1.0997 respectively . The parameter 𝜂 is an effort-adjustment factor which can be modified to incorporate subjective assessments of product, hardware, personnel, and project attributes. Since we do not have a prior for each project, we set 𝜂 to the default value of one. To obtain the price ( 𝑃 ( ) of each OSS project, we  then  multiply  the  results  of  equation  (3)  by  the  weighted  global  wage  that  an  average programmer would obtain on the open market. To calculate a global wage, we include the base monthly salaries of software developers from Salary Expert for the top 30 countries in terms of their GitHub developer counts in 2021 (Wachs et al., 2022). 17 The weight of each country is its share of active GitHub contributors over the total contributors in the top 30 countries. We further create bounds by using a low-wage (India) and high-wage (USA) labor market for the wage to better understand how the value would vary by the pool of programmers used to recreate all of OSS. 18\n\nDocument 8: ## 3. Methodology\n\nWe first measure the value of OSS by considering the supply and the demand side of OSS using a labor market approach. 14 The thought experiment is that we live in a world where OSS does not exist and has to be recreated at each firm that uses a given piece of OSS. Using the labor market approach, we calculate the labor replacement cost of each OSS package. To estimate the value for each package, we use COCOMO II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) at the individual package level and then sum across all package values to obtain a supply-side labor market replacement value. Then, we scale the supply-side value by the number of times firms are using each package while removing multi-usage within each firm to obtain a demand-side value.\n\nSecond, we move beyond the aggregate and inspect inequality in the value creation process. In OSS, as with many creative endeavors, it is common that a small handful of individuals provide the bulk of the contributions, while many others make small contributions (sometimes referred to as the 80\/20 rule, implying 80% of the work is done by 20% of the people). Research has shown these frequent contributors often attain positions of influence in OSS communities as a result of their efforts (Hanisch, et al, 2018). Therefore, to better understand the dispersion of value creation across developers, we first use the GHTorrent data and identify individual developer contributions in two ways: a) through their OSS value contributions directly and b) through the total number of repositories they contributed to. We then test how concentrated these two contribution measures are to better understand whether many or few developers contribute to the total value we measure. We explain the exact details for the labor market approach and the inequality of valuations below.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"situational","seed_document_id":21,"situational_context":"A researcher preparing a presentation on valuation methodologies for OSS is analyzing different approaches to estimate economic value, focusing on the goods-market valuation method described in the Harvard Business School's OSS report.","topic":"Others"}}

In the first step, we measure the value contributions by developers. In a second step, we obtain a measure for the number of repositories developers contribute to. Finally, we provide a graphical representation of both using the commonly known concept of the Lorenz curve to better understand the extent of inequality in contributions. We describe the details below.\n\nValue Contribution. We calculated the supply and demand values of OSS that each developer contributed. At the repository level, we quantified each developer's proportional work contribution by calculating their share of commits to the total number of commits for a repository. This share was subsequently multiplied with the repository's demand and supply values separately to derive\n\n17 There are 179 counties in Wachs et al. (2022), but the top 30 countries consist of over 88% of the global active contributors with each of the rest having less than 0.6% share.

This  measure  entails  the  variety  of  OSS  needs  being  addressed  by  individual developers. Jointly with the value contribution measure, they help us understand whether the value that is being generated overall is concentrated within a small number of developers. It may be generally more desirable for the whole OSS ecosystem and its diversity if individual developers participate in many repositories and not just a few.\n\nMeasuring  the  Dispersion  of  Contributions . To  graphically  examine  the  dispersion  of developer contribution values, we utilized Lorenz curves (Lorenz, 1905), with respect to both demand and supply side values. Lorenz curves are a well-established way to represent inequality and, as such, they allow us to better understand how dispersed developer contributions to OSS within the private economy are. Developers are systematically arranged in ascending order based on their contributions to OSS demand and supply, as delineated in Equation (7). Subsequently, these ranks were normalized to a scale ranging from 0 to 100 percentiles, serving as the x-axis values for the Lorenz Curves. The y-axis, on the other hand, presents the corresponding value contributions 𝑉 -+.\/ . The graphical representation in the results section will elucidate the degree of inequality pertaining to the value contributions among developers. To supplement the analysis, we\n\nfurther investigated how dispersed the repository contribution, 𝑁 +.\/ , is by plotting Equation (8).

The  inward-facing Census  (Panel  A)  contains  just  over  261.7  million  lines  of  code  with  72%  of  the  lines  being attributable to the top programming languages. The average package includes 142 thousand lines of code with a slightly lower average of 113 thousand lines of code for the subset of top languages. When considering the demand (usage) side, we observe that the Census packages were used over 2.7 million times while 92% of this usage is attributable to the top languages. The average package was used 1,472.4 times with a higher usage of around 1,497.5 for the top  languages.  For  the outward-facing  BuiltWith  data  we  find  similar  patterns,  but  at  different  levels.  The  packages included from BuiltWith include over 82 million lines of code, 71% of which are attributable to the  top  programming  languages.  The  average  package  within  the  BuiltWith  sample  has  111 thousand  lines  of  code  with  a  lower  average  of  around  80  thousand  lines  of  code  for  the  top languages. This is because our BuiltWith data primarily consists of JavaScript-based packages, which are often smaller than packages written in other languages. BuiltWith packages were used over 142 thousand times where 99.97% were attributable to the top languages. Next, we used these raw observations to calculate the value of all OSS through the labor market approach and estimated the value created from the supply and demand side.\n\n--- Table 2 about here ---\n\nTable 2 shows the estimates for the value of OSS based on the firm-relevant joint Census and BuiltWith sample. All estimates in Table 2 are based only on software languages classified in bucket  1  from  Table  A1,  which  are  the  most  likely  to  be  written  by  a  human  rather  than  a machine. 19 The first column contains estimates with wages from a low income country (India), the global  average  wage,  and  a  high  income  country  (United  States  of  America),  respectively  (as described above). To reproduce all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the idea of OSS still exists, but all current OSS is deleted and needs to be coded from scratch), using programmers at the average developer wage from India, it would require an investment of $1.22 billion. In contrast, if we use the average developer wage from the United States, then reproducing all widely-used OSS would require  an  investment  of  $6.22  billion.  Using  a  pool  of  programmers  from  across  the  world, weighed based on the existing geographic contributions to OSS as discussed above, would lead to an investment somewhere in between the low and high-income country, $4.15 billion. It is useful to compare these numbers to those from similar studies to understand differences in valuing all OSS (prior studies) versus that which is widely used (our study). Robbins et al. (2021) and Blind et al. (2021) use a method similar to ours and estimate that the value of OSS created in the US is $38 billion in 2019 and that created in the EU is €1 billion in 2018. Wachs et al. (2022) show that roughly 50% of OSS contributions come from the US and EU combined. In aggregate, that would lead these studies to give a global value of OSS of $78 billion. Thus, our middle estimate of a supply-side value of $4.15 billion for only firm-oriented and widely used OSS is a credible lowerbound and highlights the higher estimations of the total of supply-side value of OSS when not considering whether or not a given OSS package is widely used. This further indicates that the supply-side value of the most widely used OSS is roughly 5.5% of the supply-side value of all OSS.\n\nThe second column in Table 2 contains the demand side estimates based on the labor market approach. We find that if firms had to recreate all OSS packages they used (e.g., OSS itself no longer existed and every firm that used an OSS package had to recreate it), then the entire cost would amount to between $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion using labor from the low wage or high wage country only, respectively. A pool of programmers across the globe could recreate all of OSS that is being widely used for a cost of approximately $8.80 trillion. Interpreting this number is\n\n19 Tables in the appendix show the equivalent values from Table 2 when including software language buckets 1 and 2 (Table A3) and all three software language buckets (Table A4).\n\nslightly more complicated but still feasible. According to a Statista (2023) report, global software revenue in 2020 (the same year as our data) was $531.7 billion. However, this represents a flow, not a stock, of software. Relying on government estimates that software fully depreciates over three years, we can do a back of the envelope calculation and consider the purchase value of the full stock of prepackaged software used in 2020 as the aggregate of that sold from 2018 to 2020, which is $1.54 trillion. Further, this represents only the expenditure on prepackaged software and does  not  include  custom  purchased  or  in-house  developed  software.  Here,  the  best  obtainable estimates of private-sector investment in software overall come from the United States National Income and Product Accounts data (NIPA 2023). In 2020, the national account data shows that in the  US,  private  firms  spent  $479.2  billion  on  software,  of  which  45%  ($215.5  billion)  was prepackaged. If we assume this is a consistent ratio for the rest of the world, then the total amount firms spent on software being used in 2020 was $3.4 trillion (= $1.54 trillion\/0.45). Combining this rough estimate with the demand side estimate of the value of OSS based on an average global wage ($8.8 trillion), this indicates firms would spend $12.2 trillion (=$3.4 trillion + $8.8 trillion), or three and a half times what they currently spend if they needed to pay in-house developers to write the OSS that they currently use for free.\n\nDocument 14: ## --- Figure 2 about here ---\n\nFigure 2 splits the OSS value estimates for each language by our inward facing (Census) and outward facing (BuiltWith) data sources. Panel A and Panel B focus on the supply and demand side estimation for the Census. We obtain a similar pattern that has been established already in the aggregate when pooling both data sources (Figure 1) albeit the impact of JavaScript is substantially lower.  On  the  supply  side  of  the  Census  in  Panel  A,  Java  has  the  second-highest  value  while JavaScript  code  from  the  Census  contributes  to  a  substantially  lower  value  to  the  aggregate. Similarly, the supply side values of C, Python, and Typescript are mainly driven by the Census. From the demand side Panel B we find that Go is the most popular language for inward facing code while all other languages appear to be negligible in relative terms.\n\nFigure 2, Panel C and Panel D show the supply and demand side values for the BuiltWith dataset. The supply side value in Panel C clearly indicates that the value from the BuiltWith sample is driven by JavaScript code, which is a good sanity check since we focused on JavaScript packages to proxy for OSS in the BuiltWith sample, as discussed above. The second highest value is created by TypeScript which is reassuring since it is a superset of JavaScript. Panel D shows a similar pattern  on  the  usage  side  where  most  of  the  value  arises  from  JavaScript  while  TypeScript  is trailing at the second spot as well. The other languages contribute only marginal amounts to the supply and demand side values. Overall, these findings are broadly consistent with the main use cases of the various languages (web programming vs. application programming) and an idea that languages through which value are generated are not necessarily identical to languages that are used by the general public.\n\n--- Figure 3 about here ---\n\nFigure 3 shows the demand-side value of OSS across industries by NAICS 2-digit codes using the BuiltWith online data. 20 This can be interpreted as the value each of these industries receive because OSS exists. The industry with the highest usage value of around $43 billion is 'Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.' 'Retail Trade' as well as 'Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services' make up another large part of the demand-side externally facing value of OSS with $36 billion and $35 billion, respectively. In contrast, industries that constitute just a small portion of the value are 'Mining, Quarrying, and Oil  and  Gas  Extraction',  'Utilities',  'Agriculture,  Forestry,  Fishing,  and  Hunting.'  The  latter industries are classical non-service sector industries and as such software is expected to play less of a role there.\n\nDocument 16: ## 5. Conclusion\n\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith. We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average value and distributed it across industries.\n\nIn this study we estimate the value of widely-used open source software globally with two unique datasets: the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data. We are able to estimate not only the supply side value of existing code (e.g., the cost it would take to rewrite each piece of widely-used OSS once) but also the demand side value for the private economy (e.g., the cost it would take for each company that uses a piece of OSS to rewrite it). While we do not focus on the long tail of OSS, we consider this an additional contribution of our study as focusing on OSS that is widely used allows us to more precisely understand the value created by OSS, rather than only measuring the  replacement  cost  for  all  OSS  (which  would  overestimate  the  true  value  since  many  OSS projects are not used in production code). However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n\nAdjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.  We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves.  Over  95%  percent  of  the  demand-side  value  is  generated  by  only  five  percent  of programmers, and those programmers contribute not only to a few widely used projects but to substantially more projects than the programmers that are engaged at the lower end of the value distribution.\n\nIn aggregate, our results show the substantial value that OSS contributes to the economy despite this value generally showing up as zero via direct measurement since prices equal zero and quantity is difficult to measure using public data alone. Our research lays the groundwork for future studies of not only OSS, but of all IT and its growing impact on the global economy.\n\nDocument 9: ## 3.1 Labor market approach\n\nFor the labor market approach, we estimate the value of OSS by calculating the replacement value of a package. We ask how much it would cost to reproduce the package by hiring a programmer and paying them a competitive market wage. To estimate this supply-side value ( 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; ) , we take the complete list of OSS packages discussed above, and then count the lines of code in each unique\n\n14 In an alternative version, we use a mixture of a labor and goods market approach that is more closely aligned with Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff, et al (2021). However, applying this method in our setting requires numerous additional assumptions due to data constraints. For simplicity we call it the goods market approach for which we provide the details and statistics, as well as the limitations in Appendix A.\n\npackage. 15 For each unique package,  , we calculate the value and then sum over all these values i to obtain the total value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nIn this calculation, we implicitly do not incorporate any production externalities since we assume that there is no spillover knowledge from one package to the next that would lower the cost of programming. 16 This methodology is similar to that used by other papers that estimate the supply-side costs of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021).\n\nWe then calculate the demand-side value of OSS by incorporating the usage information ( Q) for each package:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nHere, we do not incorporate consumption externalities, i.e., we do not allow a benefit to arise for the general public when a package has been created and we further make sure that each firm is only replacing a package they use once, since a replaced package can be used within a firm as a club good (e.g., see Cornes and Sandler, 1996). The value 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost to rewrite all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the concept of OSS still exists, but all of these packages needed to be rewritten from scratch), while the value 𝑉 + \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost for each firm that uses one of these OSS packages to pay a developer to rewrite those packages (e.g., OSS itself no longer exists).\n\nFor both the supply and demand models, we obtain the dollar-value for each package ( 𝑃 ( ) via the Constructive Cost Model II, also abbreviated as COCOMO II (Boehm 1984, Boehm et al. 2009). The model has previously been used by the United States Department of Defense to estimate software project costs as well as in prior research estimating the value of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021). It is a highly flexible model that allows us to create non-linear transformations of lines of code to dollar-values. It uses the following modelling equation:\n\n15 We use only the pure lines of code excluding documentation lines and empty lines. Hence, we underestimate the true value of recreating each package.\n\n16 Similar to a representative agent model (e.g. see Williamson 2006), one may think of each package being reproduced by separate programmers who are identical replicas of each other (and therefore have the same skill level, but do not become more efficient via learning).\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n( (\n\nwhere 𝐿 represents the lines of codes in thousands and E the effort in person-month units for each project  . Consistent with Blind et al. (2021), we use the default parameter values for i 𝛼 , 𝛽 and 𝜂. The parameters 𝛼 𝛽 , are non-linear adjustment factors set to 2.94, and 1.0997 respectively . The parameter 𝜂 is an effort-adjustment factor which can be modified to incorporate subjective assessments of product, hardware, personnel, and project attributes. Since we do not have a prior for each project, we set 𝜂 to the default value of one. To obtain the price ( 𝑃 ( ) of each OSS project, we  then  multiply  the  results  of  equation  (3)  by  the  weighted  global  wage  that  an  average programmer would obtain on the open market. To calculate a global wage, we include the base monthly salaries of software developers from Salary Expert for the top 30 countries in terms of their GitHub developer counts in 2021 (Wachs et al., 2022). 17 The weight of each country is its share of active GitHub contributors over the total contributors in the top 30 countries. We further create bounds by using a low-wage (India) and high-wage (USA) labor market for the wage to better understand how the value would vary by the pool of programmers used to recreate all of OSS. 18","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"situational","seed_document_id":12,"situational_context":"A curious business analyst rummages through research papers to grasp the financial implications of Open Source Software, intrigued by the vast economic value outlined in the Harvard Business School's OSS report.","topic":"Others"}}

Introduction\n\nIn 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that 'software is eating the world' (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that 'open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,' (Jacks, 2022). Other recent studies have come to similar conclusions showing that open source software  (OSS)  -  software  whose  source  code  is  publicly  available  for  inspection,  use,  and modification and is often created in a decentralized manner and distributed for free - appears in 96% of codebases (Synopsys 2023), and that some commercial software consists of up to 99.9% freely available OSS (Musseau et al., 2022). Although in its early days OSS frequently copied features from existing proprietary software, OSS today includes cutting edge technology in various fields including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, big data, and analytics.  However, despite the increasing importance of OSS to all software (and therefore to the entire economy), measuring its impact has been elusive. Traditionally, to measure the value created by a good or service,  economists  multiply  the  price  ( p )  times  the  quantity  sold  ( q ).  However,  in  OSS, p is generally zero since the source code is publicly available, and q is  unknown due to the limited number of restrictions around how the code may be copied and reused. For example, if a company downloads  a  piece  of  OSS  from  a  public  code  repository,  it  may  copy  it  thousands  of  times internally (legally) and then share it with suppliers or customers (also legally), so public download data is insufficient. Although some recent studies have sought to estimate the value of p (discussed below), data for estimating q has been unavailable or intractable for anything more than just a handful of OSS packages. Using newly collected data from multiple sources, the goal of this paper is to provide estimates for both p and q and to use those to shine light on the question: What is the value of open source software?\n\nUnderstanding the value of OSS is of critical importance not only due to the role it plays in the economy, but also due to it being one of the most successful and impactful modern examples of the centuries old economic concept of 'the commons' which run the risk of meeting the fate known as 'the tragedy of the commons.' This concept can trace its roots as far back as the 4 th -century BC philosopher Aristotle who wrote 'That which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care. Men pay most attention to what is their own and care less for what is common.'  (Aristotle,  1981).  William  Forster  Lloyd  (1833)  resurfaced  the  idea  in  modern economic thought by highlighting the example of shared tracts of land used for cattle grazing by\n\nmultiple cattle herders who each had an incentive to overuse the shared resource. Garrett Hardin (1968)  brought  the  concept  into  the  broader  zeitgeist  when  he  wrote  an  article  discussing  the problem entitled 'The Tragedy of the Commons.' Building on this work, Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for her research highlighting paths to avoiding the tragedy of the commons through community coordination efforts that did not necessitate government enforced laws to manage and guard the commons (Ostrom 1990). The parallels between shared grazing lands and shared digital infrastructure are palpable - the availability of communal grass to feed cattle, and in turn feed people, was critical to the agrarian economy, and the ability to not have to recreate code that someone else has already written is critical to the modern economy. Further, in both contexts, despite knowing grass and code are critical inputs to the economy, measuring their actual value is difficult. And, as the renowned mathematician and physicist Lord Kelvin is believed to have said, 'If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.' And if you cannot improve and maintain it, such common goods may crumble under the weight of their own success as they are overused, but underinvested in (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021). Therefore, measuring the value OSS creates is crucial to the future health of the digital economy, and the rest of the economy that is built on top of it.\n\nImportantly, recent studies have attempted to address these measurement issues but fall short of capturing both the breadth and depth of OSS usage - a gap we seek to fill with this paper. For example, researchers have attempted to gain breadth by using novel methodologies to estimate the labor replacement value of the current corpus of OSS created in the United States at $38 billion in 2019 (Robbins et al., 2021) and that created in the European Union at €1 billion (Blind et al., 2021) by imputing the labor costs that it would have taken to rewrite existing OSS. Such efforts do a very good job at estimating what it would cost to replace all existing OSS if it disappeared tomorrow. However, the resultant estimates rely on two important assumptions. First, that all OSS is equally valuable from a usage standpoint, and second that the concept of OSS would still exist, and society would just need to rewrite the code once, thus addressing the aforementioned problem of a missing value for p , but not addressing the missing value of q . In a world where OSS did not exist at all, then each piece of OSS software would not need to be rewritten just once, but instead would need to be rewritten by every firm that used the software (assuming the firm could freely share the software within its boundaries). Other research (Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; MurcianoGoroff, Zhuo, and Greenstein, 2021) has gone deeper into this hypothetical, albeit in a narrow\n\nmanner, by only focusing on web servers (which are public facing on the Internet and can therefore be readily measured). Using different methods, both studies measure q for this one type of software and impute p by using a goods replacement value approach based on the prices for closed-source alternatives offered by firms. With data from the United States the resulting estimates show a value of  $2  billion  for  the  OSS  Apache  Web  Server  in  2012  (Greenstein  and  Nagle,  2014)  and  a combined value of $4.5 billion for Apache and the increasingly popular OSS web server nginx in 2018 (Murciano-Goroff, et al., 2021). However, although web servers are an important part of the OSS  ecosystem,  they  constitute  a  small  portion  of  it.  We  seek  to  build  upon  the  important contributions this existing research has made in an attempt to go both broad and deep to create a more complete measure of the value of OSS.\n\nTo consider the value of OSS in both a broad and deep manner, we use data from two primary sources that allow us to gain insights into the OSS used at tens of thousands of firms across the world. The first is the 'Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries' (Nagle et al., 2022). The Census II project utilized partnerships with multiple software composition analysis (SCA) firms to create various lists of the most widely used OSS. SCAs are hired to scan the codebases of a company to ensure they are not violating any OSS licenses and, as a byproduct, track all the OSS code used by their customers and the products they build. The Census II project aggregated data from multiple SCAs to build a dataset of OSS usage at tens of thousands of firms based  on  millions  of  data  points  (observations  of  OSS  usage).  The  second  data  source  is  the BuiltWith dataset, from which we leverage scans of nearly nine million websites to identify the underlying technology deployed by these websites, including OSS libraries. The BuiltWith data has been used in multiple academic studies (DeStefano &amp; Timmis 2023, Dushnitsky &amp; Stroube 2021, Koning et al.. 2022), but to our knowledge this is the first one to focus on OSS usage. The Census II data and the BuiltWith data are complementary as the former focuses on OSS that is built  into  the  software  a  company  sells,  while  the  latter  focuses  on  OSS  that  is  built  into  a company's website, thus reducing the chances of double-counting observations across the datasets. In aggregate, these two datasets combined create the most complete measurement of OSS usage ( q ) to date. Further, by focusing on OSS that is widely deployed and used by firms, rather than considering all the projects that exist in an OSS repository, we enhance the methodologies of prior studies by reducing the likelihood of measurement error stemming from projects that are posted as publicly available OSS but are not actually used in any practical manner. Not accounting for this\n\nmeasurement error would lead to overestimation of the actual value of OSS as projects that are widely used would be valued in the same way as projects that are not used at all.\n\nTo estimate p ,  we  follow  the  literature  discussed  above  and  use  the  labor  replacement value. First, we calculate the labor cost it would take an individual firm to recreate a given OSS package by measuring the number of lines of code within the package and then applying the Constructive Cost Model II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) - also known as COCOMO II to estimate the number of person-hours it would take to write the code from scratch. We then utilize global wage data from Salary Expert to get an accurate estimate of the labor costs a firm would incur if this piece of OSS did not exist. These costs can be combined with the q values from above at the OSS package level to estimate the combined value of all OSS from both the supply and demand sides.\n\nWe find a value ranging from $1.22 billion to $6.22 billion if we were to decide as a society to recreate all widely used OSS on the supply side. However, considering the actual usage of OSS leads to a demand-side value that is orders of magnitude larger and ranges from $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion, if each firm who used an OSS package had to recreate it from scratch (e.g., the concept of OSS did not exist). We document substantial heterogeneity of the value of OSS by programming  language  and  internal  vs  outward-facing  programming  efforts.  Further,  we  find considerable  heterogeneity  in  value  contributions  by  programmers  as  5%  of  programmers  are responsible for more than 90% of the value created on the supply- and demand- side. The data we use is arguably the most comprehensive source of data to measure the value created by firm usage of OSS at this time. However, as for any project, the evidence is not complete and we argue that we underestimate the value since our data, e.g., does not include operating systems, which are a substantial omitted category of OSS.\n\nThis study makes four important contributions to the academic literature, practitioners, and policy makers. First, it provides the most complete estimate of the value of widely used OSS to date  by  accounting  for  not  only  the  supply-side  of  OSS  (price  to  create  it),  but  also  for  the usage\/demand-side at a scale that has not been done before. While prior estimates of the value of OSS only went either broad (estimating the supply-side costs of a large swath of OSS) or deep (estimating the value created by one particular type of OSS), this study does both by using unique datasets that allow for a better understanding of the breadth and depth of OSS usage. Further, rather than measuring the value of all OSS, this study focuses on the value of OSS that is used by firms\n\nto create its products and websites, limiting the measurement error occurring in studies that are unable to account for which OSS is actually used in production. This contribution builds upon, and extends, important research (e.g., Blind et al., 2021; Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021; Robbins et al., 2021) that has sought to identify the value of this vital resource that contributes a great deal to the modern economy despite the difficulties measuring this contribution. In  doing  so,  it  adds  insights  to  a  long-running  discussion  related  to  the  impact  of  information technology (IT) on productivity (Brynjolfsson, 1993; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 1996; Nagle, 2019a; Solow, 1987) known as the 'productivity paradox' where IT investments can have limited impact on productivity statistics. This debate has continued into the emerging context of AI (Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson, 2018). Our work contributes to this conversation by highlighting a massive societal level cost-savings (and hence productivity enhancement) that is created by the existence of OSS.\n\nSecond, our research contributes methodological advances to the study of intangible capital by highlighting novel sources of data related to investments in OSS. Prior research has shown that intangible capital plays an increasingly important role in economic growth (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel,  2009)  and  firm  value  (Peters  and  Taylor,  2017),  but  it  often  goes  unmeasured  or misattributed (Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou, 2014). Further, we demonstrate how these data sources can be used to understand the true investments in software that a firm makes, and that which they would have to make if OSS did not exist.  This  is  valuable  as  investments  in  software  are  an increasingly important type of intangible capital that is driving innovation (Branstetter, Drev, and Kwon, 2019) and performance (Krishnan et al., 2000).\n\nThird, our results help highlight for firms and managers the importance of OSS to their production, and ideally add weight to arguments that users of OSS should not just free ride but also contribute to the creation and maintenance of OSS (e.g., Henkel, 2008; Nagle, 2018). Such contributions are a fraction of the costs that firms would incur if OSS did not exist and the active participation of OSS users in helping maintain the OSS they use is critical to the health and future well-being of the OSS ecosystem (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021; Zhang et al., 2019).\n\nFourth,  and  finally,  our  study  helps  inform  policymakers  who  have  recently  started  to understand  the  growing  importance  of  OSS  to  the  economy  and  taken  actions  to  support  the ecosystem (European Commission, 2020; Executive Order No. 14028, 2021). However, most of these efforts are related to securing the existing OSS ecosystem, which is quite important, but do\n\nnot go as far as supporting the creation of new OSS. Our results help shine light on the importance of OSS to the overall economy and add weight to calls for more societal support of this critical resource. Our results further show that the majority of the value created by OSS is created by a small  number  of  contributors.  Although  it  has  long  been  known  that  a  small  number  of  OSS contributors do most of the work, we add new insights that show this is even more true for the value creation of widely-used OSS projects and that societal support for these individuals is critical to the future success of OSS, and in turn, the economy.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the empirical setting and data. Section 3 discusses the methods including measurement challenges. In section 4, we estimate the value of open source software. Section 5 concludes.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"situational","seed_document_id":17,"situational_context":"A tech-savvy economist is preparing a comprehensive presentation on the influence of open source software on innovation and economic growth for an upcoming international business conference.","topic":"Others"}}

Empirical Setting and Data\n\nAlthough the concept of free and open software has existed since the 1950's, it became more popular in the 1980's due to the efforts of Richard Stallman and his launch of the GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation (Maracke, 2019). However, it was in the 1990's that OSS took off after Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel, a now widely adopted OSS operating system (Tozzi, 2016). Today, OSS is considered a key building block of the digital economy and is widely used by software developers in everything from phones to cars to refrigerators to cutting-edge AI (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021).\n\nWe use two complementary main data sources to estimate the value of OSS. The first is the Census and is inward facing. It allows us to identify OSS code that goes into products that firms create. The second dataset is BuiltWith and is outward facing, allowing us to identify OSS code  that  consumers  directly  interact  with  through  firm  websites.  Since  the  raw  data  in  both datasets only contains package names, version numbers, and package manager names, and does not  contain  any  source  code  related  information,  we  first  obtain  the  publicly  accessible  code repository for each package which includes package-level information including the lines of code and  the  programming  languages  used.  One  may  worry  about  double-counting  for  the  value calculations as a result of using two separate datasets. However, the overlap of both the Census and  the  BuiltWith  sample  is  very  small:  there  are  only  18  packages  found  in  both  datasets. Moreover, it is unlikely that double counting is a concern as the two datasets capture different dimensions of OSS usage: the Census captures packaged software whose usage is inward-facing while BuiltWith captures usage in websites that are outward-facing. Finally, as a supplementary\n\ndataset, we use GHTorrent, a detailed history of OSS-related activity on GitHub, the most popular OSS hosting platform and a commonly used data source for studies of OSS (e.g., Burton et al, 2017; Conti, Peukert, and Roche, 2023; Fackler, Hofmann, and Laurentsyeva, 2023; Kim, 2020; Tang, Wang, &amp; Tong, 2023). This detailed historical data allows us to go deeper into how the value  of  OSS  is  created  by  better  understanding  the  dispersion  of  the  contributions  across individual OSS developers. We describe the details of all three data sources and their preparation for estimation below.\n\nCensus. The  Census  II  of  Free  and  Open  Source  Software  (here:  Census)  was  jointly undertaken by the Linux Foundation and the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (Nagle et  al.,  2022). 1 The  Census  was  created  via  the  aggregation  of  data  from  three  major  software composition analysis (SCA) firms with thousands of clients across the globe. SCAs are hired to scan the codebase of a client and gather the OSS usage embedded in their proprietary software to ensure they are not violating any OSS license agreements.  Frequently this takes place as part of 2 the due diligence process related to mergers and acquisitions. Unlike other OSS demand measures available from public sources such as package download counts and code changes, the way this data was collected ensures that we observe the precise amount and type of internal OSS usage of the firms. In addition, it allows us to trace the dependencies each package relies on, so that we can observe the indirect OSS usage that is commonly hidden and difficult to obtain.  The result is over 3 2.7 million observations of OSS packages being used within products created by the SCA client firms for the calendar year 2020 (January 1 to December 31, 2020). 4\n\nThe Census project standardized package names based on the naming system of libraries.io -  a  widely  used  site  maintained  by  Tidelift  that  organizes  information  about  more  than  eight million open source packages. The Census focused on the top 2,000 packages based on usage\n\n1 The precise methodologies for the data collection and aggregation are detailed in the Census report by Nagle et al (2022).\n\n2 OSS usage licenses vary a great deal and while some licenses are very open and allow the code to be reused in any manner, including within proprietary code that will be made available for sale at a non-zero price, other licenses restrict reuse to only be allowed if the resultant code is released under the same OSS license (known as copyleft). A detailed discussion of OSS licenses can be found in Lerner and Tirole (2005) and Almeida et al (2017).\n\n3 Indirect OSS usage is captured by dependency analysis and is necessary to accurately measure the full breadth of the OSS a firm relies on. For example, if a firm's proprietary code calls OSS package A, but package A, in turn, calls package B, then only looking at the direct calls would miss that package B was a required building block for the firm's proprietary code.\n\n4 The Census defines an OSS package as 'a unit of software that can be installed and managed by a package manager,' and  defines  a  package  manager  as  'software  that  automates  the  process  of  installing  and  otherwise  managing packages' (Nagle et al, 2022).\n\nreported from the three of the most prominent SCA vendors to identify the most widely used OSS rather  than  the  long-tail  of  the  usage  distribution.  This  led  to  packages  with  less  than  five observations  of  usage  being  dropped.  Since  packages  written  in  the  JavaScript  programming language, and usually hosted on the Node Package Manager (NPM), are generally smaller (fewer lines  of  code)  than  packages  in  other  languages  and  therefore  frequently  have  higher  usage numbers (since developers must include many small packages instead of a few large packages), the Census separately selected the top 1,000 NPM packages and the top 1,000 non-NPM hosted packages.\n\nThis final dataset covers 70% of the total usage of OSS observed in the raw data of the census.   For  each  of  these  2,000  OSS  packages  in  the  Census,  we  identified  the  raw  code 5 maintained on GitHub, the most widely used platform for hosting OSS.  We first attempted to 6 obtain the GitHub repository uniform resource locator (URL) for each package from libraries.io. We were able to match 1,657 packages to repositories via this initial method.  For URLs without 7 a  matching  repository,  we  performed  Google  searches  loosely  following  the  method  in  Singh (2020). More specifically, for each unmatched package, we used the Google API to search for the package name and 'GitHub Repository' and treated the first GitHub repository URL in the results as  its  best  matched  GitHub  URL.   This  resulted  in  an  additional  174  packages  matched  to  a 8 repository. Finally, we manually searched for URLs for the remaining 169 packages to identify the relevant repository. This entire process resulted in matching 1,840 out of the 2,000 Census packages to a code repository with the raw source code for the package. The unmatched packages were determined to have been either removed from GitHub or became proprietary (and thus the original source code was no longer available) and hence, the manual search allowed us to drop\n\n5 The packages that made up the remaining 30% of the full Census data in the long-tail usage distribution were not shared in the final report and therefore cannot be included in our analysis.\n\n6 GitHub  is  a  hosting  and  collaboration  platform  that  contributors  can  use  to  coordinate  the  development  and distribution of OSS projects. Founded in 2008, GitHub has become the largest hub for OSS development in the world. In January 2023, GitHub had more than 370 million repositories and over 100 million developers. In addition to personal users, a wide range of private firms actively use the GitHub platform, including Microsoft (which bought GitHub in 2018), Facebook, Google, and numerous other small and large firms.\n\n7 We attempted to access all repository URLs obtained as a sanity check to ensure they are in working condition. For those we could not access on GitHub, we manually found the correct URLs.\n\n8 As a robustness check, we randomly selected 50 package-repository matches derived from the Google Search method and we checked them by hand. All matches were manually confirmed to be correct providing additional support for the automated matching method.\n\nthese 160 unmatched packages (less than 8% of the Census sample of 2,000) with high confidence from our analysis.\n\nBuiltWith. The BuiltWith data contains scans of all public websites across the globe and identifies the technologies they use. Unlike the inward facing Census data which focus on the usage of OSS, the BuiltWith data scan for the use of both proprietary and OSS in firm websites without explicit differentiation. To separate OSS from proprietary software in BuiltWith, we turn to the subset of all open source web development software in the technology category that includes \"JavaScript and its libraries,\" which generates 778 observations corresponding to the NPM OSS category  in  the  Census  data.  There  are  two  reasons  for  this  sampling  choice.  First,  this  given category is constructed by BuiltWith and we use it as a proxy for OSS to separate it from pecuniary software.  Second,  JavaScript,  one  of  the  core  technologies  for  building  websites,  is  the  most popular programming language by usage on GitHub (GitHub, 2022) and thus enables us to capture the most important OSS from the demand side perspective. The scans include 8.8 million unique websites and 72.8 million corresponding observations of OSS usage from January 1 to November 16, 2020. Further, to ensure that we measure the value of OSS usage generated by the private sector,  we  match  the  adopting  domains  of  the  JavaScript-related  OSS  from  BuiltWith  with company websites recorded in Orbis, Compustat, and PitchBook, three commonly used databases of corporate activity that capture registered businesses across the world. Performing this match ensures that OSS used by non-commercial websites (e.g., an individual person's personal website) is excluded in our analysis. This results in a match-rate of 38.6%, which corresponds to around 3.4 million websites of distinct firms.\n\nFor the BuiltWith data, we cannot employ the first method we use for the Census (using libraries.io to help identify the repository URL) since only the technology names associated with the  packages  were  provided  by  BuiltWith,  and  other  information  (e.g.,  package  and  package manager  names)  is  not  included. 9 Hence,  we  start  by  performing  the  Google  Search  method mentioned above which results in a match of 695 packages to repositories. We then manually searched the Github URLs for 83 of the remaining unmatched packages, resulting in an addition of 46 packages. In total, for the BuiltWith data we were able to identify 741 out of 778 package-\n\n9 Since the package and package manager names are missing, a precise match using libraries.io was not feasible. Technology names are product names intended for customers and can be less technical and precise than the package names for internal development purposes. Thus, using technology names in a libraries.io search could cause significant ambiguity.\n\nrepository matches. As with the Census data, the remaining 37 unmatched packages (less than 5%) are dropped from our analysis because they had been deleted from GitHub.\n\nGHTorrent database. To obtain measures of the dispersion of the OSS value creation, we utilize  the  GHTorrent  database,  which  contains  the  entire  activity  history  on  GitHub  using GitHub's Representational State Transfer (REST) application programming interface (API). We leveraged  its  records  of  GitHub  repositories,  developer-level  commits,  and  developer  public profile information to estimate the contribution of each developer. We narrowed the sample for our developer contribution analysis in two steps. First, we winnowed the GitHub repositories and their  commits  from  GHTorrent  based  on  the  repository  URLs  of  our  joint  Census-BuiltWith sample. 10 Second, we focus on human contributions to OSS by removing approximately eight thousand (12%) GitHub contributors that we considered to be robots. 11 The final sample contains around sixty thousand developers and 2.3 million commits.\n\nTo prepare these three datasets for estimation, we first identified the number of lines of code and the programming languages used for each package using the OSS packages pygount (to count  the  number  of  lines  of  code)  and  linguist  (to  identify  programming  languages). 12 We categorize each distinct language into one of three different buckets moving from more likely human-written to more likely machine-written (see Table A1). Bucket 1 contains programming and markup languages (which are most likely to be human-written), bucket 3 contains data (most likely to be machine-written), and bucket 2 contains anything in between, such as config files and batch processing (which are sometimes human-written and sometimes machine-written, but it is difficult to tell based purely on looking at the code). 13 For our primary estimation we only use bucket 1 while providing robustness checks for buckets 2 and 3 in the Appendix, and thus our results represent a lower bound. Finally, for some analyses we dig deeper and show the top 5 programming languages (as classified by GitHub, 2022 for the year 2020; the year our data is from). The top 5 programming languages contain C (including C# and C++), Java, JavaScript,\n\n10 The match rate is over 96%, with the unmatched repositories accounting for only 0.15% of our calculated OSS demand value discussed below.\n\n11 The filtering is based on the 'fake user' classification by GHTorrent, as well as any usernames containing words 'bot' or 'robot', surrounded by special characters. This method is more conservative than other methods of bot detection  like  that  used  in  the  GitHub  Innovation  Graph  (https:\/\/innovationgraph.github.com\/),  which  rely  on  a monthly commit frequency threshold.\n\n12 https:\/\/pypi.org\/project\/pygount\/ and https:\/\/github.com\/github-linguist\/linguist\n\n13 Note that our focus is the cost to recreate OSS code written by humans, not robots. However, directly removing all OSS contributions from robot accounts is infeasible here, because we cannot observe the exact lines of code written by the robot accounts on GitHub.\n\nPython, and Typescript. We also add Go to this list of top languages since it is an increasingly widely used language in OSS.\n\nDocument 16: ## 5. Conclusion\n\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith. We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average value and distributed it across industries.\n\nIn this study we estimate the value of widely-used open source software globally with two unique datasets: the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data. We are able to estimate not only the supply side value of existing code (e.g., the cost it would take to rewrite each piece of widely-used OSS once) but also the demand side value for the private economy (e.g., the cost it would take for each company that uses a piece of OSS to rewrite it). While we do not focus on the long tail of OSS, we consider this an additional contribution of our study as focusing on OSS that is widely used allows us to more precisely understand the value created by OSS, rather than only measuring the  replacement  cost  for  all  OSS  (which  would  overestimate  the  true  value  since  many  OSS projects are not used in production code). However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n\nAdjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.  We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves.  Over  95%  percent  of  the  demand-side  value  is  generated  by  only  five  percent  of programmers, and those programmers contribute not only to a few widely used projects but to substantially more projects than the programmers that are engaged at the lower end of the value distribution.\n\nIn aggregate, our results show the substantial value that OSS contributes to the economy despite this value generally showing up as zero via direct measurement since prices equal zero and quantity is difficult to measure using public data alone. Our research lays the groundwork for future studies of not only OSS, but of all IT and its growing impact on the global economy.\n\nDocument 6: ## 1. Introduction\n\nIn 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that 'software is eating the world' (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that 'open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,' (Jacks, 2022). Other recent studies have come to similar conclusions showing that open source software  (OSS)  -  software  whose  source  code  is  publicly  available  for  inspection,  use,  and modification and is often created in a decentralized manner and distributed for free - appears in 96% of codebases (Synopsys 2023), and that some commercial software consists of up to 99.9% freely available OSS (Musseau et al., 2022). Although in its early days OSS frequently copied features from existing proprietary software, OSS today includes cutting edge technology in various fields including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, big data, and analytics.  However, despite the increasing importance of OSS to all software (and therefore to the entire economy), measuring its impact has been elusive. Traditionally, to measure the value created by a good or service,  economists  multiply  the  price  ( p )  times  the  quantity  sold  ( q ).  However,  in  OSS, p is generally zero since the source code is publicly available, and q is  unknown due to the limited number of restrictions around how the code may be copied and reused. For example, if a company downloads  a  piece  of  OSS  from  a  public  code  repository,  it  may  copy  it  thousands  of  times internally (legally) and then share it with suppliers or customers (also legally), so public download data is insufficient. Although some recent studies have sought to estimate the value of p (discussed below), data for estimating q has been unavailable or intractable for anything more than just a handful of OSS packages. Using newly collected data from multiple sources, the goal of this paper is to provide estimates for both p and q and to use those to shine light on the question: What is the value of open source software?\n\nUnderstanding the value of OSS is of critical importance not only due to the role it plays in the economy, but also due to it being one of the most successful and impactful modern examples of the centuries old economic concept of 'the commons' which run the risk of meeting the fate known as 'the tragedy of the commons.' This concept can trace its roots as far back as the 4 th -century BC philosopher Aristotle who wrote 'That which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care. Men pay most attention to what is their own and care less for what is common.'  (Aristotle,  1981).  William  Forster  Lloyd  (1833)  resurfaced  the  idea  in  modern economic thought by highlighting the example of shared tracts of land used for cattle grazing by\n\nmultiple cattle herders who each had an incentive to overuse the shared resource. Garrett Hardin (1968)  brought  the  concept  into  the  broader  zeitgeist  when  he  wrote  an  article  discussing  the problem entitled 'The Tragedy of the Commons.' Building on this work, Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for her research highlighting paths to avoiding the tragedy of the commons through community coordination efforts that did not necessitate government enforced laws to manage and guard the commons (Ostrom 1990). The parallels between shared grazing lands and shared digital infrastructure are palpable - the availability of communal grass to feed cattle, and in turn feed people, was critical to the agrarian economy, and the ability to not have to recreate code that someone else has already written is critical to the modern economy. Further, in both contexts, despite knowing grass and code are critical inputs to the economy, measuring their actual value is difficult. And, as the renowned mathematician and physicist Lord Kelvin is believed to have said, 'If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.' And if you cannot improve and maintain it, such common goods may crumble under the weight of their own success as they are overused, but underinvested in (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021). Therefore, measuring the value OSS creates is crucial to the future health of the digital economy, and the rest of the economy that is built on top of it.\n\nImportantly, recent studies have attempted to address these measurement issues but fall short of capturing both the breadth and depth of OSS usage - a gap we seek to fill with this paper. For example, researchers have attempted to gain breadth by using novel methodologies to estimate the labor replacement value of the current corpus of OSS created in the United States at $38 billion in 2019 (Robbins et al., 2021) and that created in the European Union at €1 billion (Blind et al., 2021) by imputing the labor costs that it would have taken to rewrite existing OSS. Such efforts do a very good job at estimating what it would cost to replace all existing OSS if it disappeared tomorrow. However, the resultant estimates rely on two important assumptions. First, that all OSS is equally valuable from a usage standpoint, and second that the concept of OSS would still exist, and society would just need to rewrite the code once, thus addressing the aforementioned problem of a missing value for p , but not addressing the missing value of q . In a world where OSS did not exist at all, then each piece of OSS software would not need to be rewritten just once, but instead would need to be rewritten by every firm that used the software (assuming the firm could freely share the software within its boundaries). Other research (Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; MurcianoGoroff, Zhuo, and Greenstein, 2021) has gone deeper into this hypothetical, albeit in a narrow\n\nmanner, by only focusing on web servers (which are public facing on the Internet and can therefore be readily measured). Using different methods, both studies measure q for this one type of software and impute p by using a goods replacement value approach based on the prices for closed-source alternatives offered by firms. With data from the United States the resulting estimates show a value of  $2  billion  for  the  OSS  Apache  Web  Server  in  2012  (Greenstein  and  Nagle,  2014)  and  a combined value of $4.5 billion for Apache and the increasingly popular OSS web server nginx in 2018 (Murciano-Goroff, et al., 2021). However, although web servers are an important part of the OSS  ecosystem,  they  constitute  a  small  portion  of  it.  We  seek  to  build  upon  the  important contributions this existing research has made in an attempt to go both broad and deep to create a more complete measure of the value of OSS.\n\nTo consider the value of OSS in both a broad and deep manner, we use data from two primary sources that allow us to gain insights into the OSS used at tens of thousands of firms across the world. The first is the 'Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries' (Nagle et al., 2022). The Census II project utilized partnerships with multiple software composition analysis (SCA) firms to create various lists of the most widely used OSS. SCAs are hired to scan the codebases of a company to ensure they are not violating any OSS licenses and, as a byproduct, track all the OSS code used by their customers and the products they build. The Census II project aggregated data from multiple SCAs to build a dataset of OSS usage at tens of thousands of firms based  on  millions  of  data  points  (observations  of  OSS  usage).  The  second  data  source  is  the BuiltWith dataset, from which we leverage scans of nearly nine million websites to identify the underlying technology deployed by these websites, including OSS libraries. The BuiltWith data has been used in multiple academic studies (DeStefano &amp; Timmis 2023, Dushnitsky &amp; Stroube 2021, Koning et al.. 2022), but to our knowledge this is the first one to focus on OSS usage. The Census II data and the BuiltWith data are complementary as the former focuses on OSS that is built  into  the  software  a  company  sells,  while  the  latter  focuses  on  OSS  that  is  built  into  a company's website, thus reducing the chances of double-counting observations across the datasets. In aggregate, these two datasets combined create the most complete measurement of OSS usage ( q ) to date. Further, by focusing on OSS that is widely deployed and used by firms, rather than considering all the projects that exist in an OSS repository, we enhance the methodologies of prior studies by reducing the likelihood of measurement error stemming from projects that are posted as publicly available OSS but are not actually used in any practical manner. Not accounting for this\n\nmeasurement error would lead to overestimation of the actual value of OSS as projects that are widely used would be valued in the same way as projects that are not used at all.\n\nTo estimate p ,  we  follow  the  literature  discussed  above  and  use  the  labor  replacement value. First, we calculate the labor cost it would take an individual firm to recreate a given OSS package by measuring the number of lines of code within the package and then applying the Constructive Cost Model II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) - also known as COCOMO II to estimate the number of person-hours it would take to write the code from scratch. We then utilize global wage data from Salary Expert to get an accurate estimate of the labor costs a firm would incur if this piece of OSS did not exist. These costs can be combined with the q values from above at the OSS package level to estimate the combined value of all OSS from both the supply and demand sides.\n\nWe find a value ranging from $1.22 billion to $6.22 billion if we were to decide as a society to recreate all widely used OSS on the supply side. However, considering the actual usage of OSS leads to a demand-side value that is orders of magnitude larger and ranges from $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion, if each firm who used an OSS package had to recreate it from scratch (e.g., the concept of OSS did not exist). We document substantial heterogeneity of the value of OSS by programming  language  and  internal  vs  outward-facing  programming  efforts.  Further,  we  find considerable  heterogeneity  in  value  contributions  by  programmers  as  5%  of  programmers  are responsible for more than 90% of the value created on the supply- and demand- side. The data we use is arguably the most comprehensive source of data to measure the value created by firm usage of OSS at this time. However, as for any project, the evidence is not complete and we argue that we underestimate the value since our data, e.g., does not include operating systems, which are a substantial omitted category of OSS.\n\nThis study makes four important contributions to the academic literature, practitioners, and policy makers. First, it provides the most complete estimate of the value of widely used OSS to date  by  accounting  for  not  only  the  supply-side  of  OSS  (price  to  create  it),  but  also  for  the usage\/demand-side at a scale that has not been done before. While prior estimates of the value of OSS only went either broad (estimating the supply-side costs of a large swath of OSS) or deep (estimating the value created by one particular type of OSS), this study does both by using unique datasets that allow for a better understanding of the breadth and depth of OSS usage. Further, rather than measuring the value of all OSS, this study focuses on the value of OSS that is used by firms\n\nto create its products and websites, limiting the measurement error occurring in studies that are unable to account for which OSS is actually used in production. This contribution builds upon, and extends, important research (e.g., Blind et al., 2021; Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021; Robbins et al., 2021) that has sought to identify the value of this vital resource that contributes a great deal to the modern economy despite the difficulties measuring this contribution. In  doing  so,  it  adds  insights  to  a  long-running  discussion  related  to  the  impact  of  information technology (IT) on productivity (Brynjolfsson, 1993; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 1996; Nagle, 2019a; Solow, 1987) known as the 'productivity paradox' where IT investments can have limited impact on productivity statistics. This debate has continued into the emerging context of AI (Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson, 2018). Our work contributes to this conversation by highlighting a massive societal level cost-savings (and hence productivity enhancement) that is created by the existence of OSS.\n\nSecond, our research contributes methodological advances to the study of intangible capital by highlighting novel sources of data related to investments in OSS. Prior research has shown that intangible capital plays an increasingly important role in economic growth (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel,  2009)  and  firm  value  (Peters  and  Taylor,  2017),  but  it  often  goes  unmeasured  or misattributed (Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou, 2014). Further, we demonstrate how these data sources can be used to understand the true investments in software that a firm makes, and that which they would have to make if OSS did not exist.  This  is  valuable  as  investments  in  software  are  an increasingly important type of intangible capital that is driving innovation (Branstetter, Drev, and Kwon, 2019) and performance (Krishnan et al., 2000).\n\nThird, our results help highlight for firms and managers the importance of OSS to their production, and ideally add weight to arguments that users of OSS should not just free ride but also contribute to the creation and maintenance of OSS (e.g., Henkel, 2008; Nagle, 2018). Such contributions are a fraction of the costs that firms would incur if OSS did not exist and the active participation of OSS users in helping maintain the OSS they use is critical to the health and future well-being of the OSS ecosystem (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021; Zhang et al., 2019).\n\nFourth,  and  finally,  our  study  helps  inform  policymakers  who  have  recently  started  to understand  the  growing  importance  of  OSS  to  the  economy  and  taken  actions  to  support  the ecosystem (European Commission, 2020; Executive Order No. 14028, 2021). However, most of these efforts are related to securing the existing OSS ecosystem, which is quite important, but do\n\nnot go as far as supporting the creation of new OSS. Our results help shine light on the importance of OSS to the overall economy and add weight to calls for more societal support of this critical resource. Our results further show that the majority of the value created by OSS is created by a small  number  of  contributors.  Although  it  has  long  been  known  that  a  small  number  of  OSS contributors do most of the work, we add new insights that show this is even more true for the value creation of widely-used OSS projects and that societal support for these individuals is critical to the future success of OSS, and in turn, the economy.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Panel A shows the supply side value with the labor value being displayed on the vertical axis. We find that OSS packages created in Go have the highest value with $803 million in value that would have to be created from scratch if the OSS packages did not exist. Go is closely followed by JavaScript  and  Java  with  $758  million  and  $658  million,  respectively.  The  value  of  C  and Typescript is $406 million and $317 million, respectively, while Python has the lowest value of the top languages with around $55 million. JavaScript is not only the top language on GitHub since at least 2014 (GitHub, 2022) it is also the language with one of the highest values in our data. In contrast, Python became more popular over time moving up from the number four spot to the number two language being used in 2020 across all OSS packages on GitHub, while it is in the last spot of our top languages.\n\nPanel B shows the demand side value across the top programming languages. Based on usage generated value, Go is more than four times the value of the next language, JavaScript.\n\nTypescript (a language that extends JavaScript) has seen immense growth rising from the tenth spot of the top 10 languages in 2017 to the fourth spot in 2020 which is also reflected in our data with  Typescript  being  the  third  most  important  language  on  the  demand  side.  The  two  web languages are followed by C and far behind are Java, and Python.\n\nDocument 14: ## --- Figure 2 about here ---\n\nFigure 2 splits the OSS value estimates for each language by our inward facing (Census) and outward facing (BuiltWith) data sources. Panel A and Panel B focus on the supply and demand side estimation for the Census. We obtain a similar pattern that has been established already in the aggregate when pooling both data sources (Figure 1) albeit the impact of JavaScript is substantially lower.  On  the  supply  side  of  the  Census  in  Panel  A,  Java  has  the  second-highest  value  while JavaScript  code  from  the  Census  contributes  to  a  substantially  lower  value  to  the  aggregate. Similarly, the supply side values of C, Python, and Typescript are mainly driven by the Census. From the demand side Panel B we find that Go is the most popular language for inward facing code while all other languages appear to be negligible in relative terms.\n\nFigure 2, Panel C and Panel D show the supply and demand side values for the BuiltWith dataset. The supply side value in Panel C clearly indicates that the value from the BuiltWith sample is driven by JavaScript code, which is a good sanity check since we focused on JavaScript packages to proxy for OSS in the BuiltWith sample, as discussed above. The second highest value is created by TypeScript which is reassuring since it is a superset of JavaScript. Panel D shows a similar pattern  on  the  usage  side  where  most  of  the  value  arises  from  JavaScript  while  TypeScript  is trailing at the second spot as well. The other languages contribute only marginal amounts to the supply and demand side values. Overall, these findings are broadly consistent with the main use cases of the various languages (web programming vs. application programming) and an idea that languages through which value are generated are not necessarily identical to languages that are used by the general public.\n\n--- Figure 3 about here ---\n\nFigure 3 shows the demand-side value of OSS across industries by NAICS 2-digit codes using the BuiltWith online data. 20 This can be interpreted as the value each of these industries receive because OSS exists. The industry with the highest usage value of around $43 billion is 'Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.' 'Retail Trade' as well as 'Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services' make up another large part of the demand-side externally facing value of OSS with $36 billion and $35 billion, respectively. In contrast, industries that constitute just a small portion of the value are 'Mining, Quarrying, and Oil  and  Gas  Extraction',  'Utilities',  'Agriculture,  Forestry,  Fishing,  and  Hunting.'  The  latter industries are classical non-service sector industries and as such software is expected to play less of a role there.\n\nDocument 12: ## --- Table 1 about here ---\n\nTable  1  shows  descriptive  statistics  from  both  data  sets  separately.  The  inward-facing Census  (Panel  A)  contains  just  over  261.7  million  lines  of  code  with  72%  of  the  lines  being attributable to the top programming languages. The average package includes 142 thousand lines of code with a slightly lower average of 113 thousand lines of code for the subset of top languages. When considering the demand (usage) side, we observe that the Census packages were used over 2.7 million times while 92% of this usage is attributable to the top languages. The average package was used 1,472.4 times with a higher usage of around 1,497.5 for the top  languages.  For  the outward-facing  BuiltWith  data  we  find  similar  patterns,  but  at  different  levels.  The  packages included from BuiltWith include over 82 million lines of code, 71% of which are attributable to the  top  programming  languages.  The  average  package  within  the  BuiltWith  sample  has  111 thousand  lines  of  code  with  a  lower  average  of  around  80  thousand  lines  of  code  for  the  top languages. This is because our BuiltWith data primarily consists of JavaScript-based packages, which are often smaller than packages written in other languages. BuiltWith packages were used over 142 thousand times where 99.97% were attributable to the top languages. Next, we used these raw observations to calculate the value of all OSS through the labor market approach and estimated the value created from the supply and demand side.\n\n--- Table 2 about here ---\n\nTable 2 shows the estimates for the value of OSS based on the firm-relevant joint Census and BuiltWith sample. All estimates in Table 2 are based only on software languages classified in bucket  1  from  Table  A1,  which  are  the  most  likely  to  be  written  by  a  human  rather  than  a machine. 19 The first column contains estimates with wages from a low income country (India), the global  average  wage,  and  a  high  income  country  (United  States  of  America),  respectively  (as described above). To reproduce all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the idea of OSS still exists, but all current OSS is deleted and needs to be coded from scratch), using programmers at the average developer wage from India, it would require an investment of $1.22 billion. In contrast, if we use the average developer wage from the United States, then reproducing all widely-used OSS would require  an  investment  of  $6.22  billion.  Using  a  pool  of  programmers  from  across  the  world, weighed based on the existing geographic contributions to OSS as discussed above, would lead to an investment somewhere in between the low and high-income country, $4.15 billion. It is useful to compare these numbers to those from similar studies to understand differences in valuing all OSS (prior studies) versus that which is widely used (our study). Robbins et al. (2021) and Blind et al. (2021) use a method similar to ours and estimate that the value of OSS created in the US is $38 billion in 2019 and that created in the EU is €1 billion in 2018. Wachs et al. (2022) show that roughly 50% of OSS contributions come from the US and EU combined. In aggregate, that would lead these studies to give a global value of OSS of $78 billion. Thus, our middle estimate of a supply-side value of $4.15 billion for only firm-oriented and widely used OSS is a credible lowerbound and highlights the higher estimations of the total of supply-side value of OSS when not considering whether or not a given OSS package is widely used. This further indicates that the supply-side value of the most widely used OSS is roughly 5.5% of the supply-side value of all OSS.\n\nThe second column in Table 2 contains the demand side estimates based on the labor market approach. We find that if firms had to recreate all OSS packages they used (e.g., OSS itself no longer existed and every firm that used an OSS package had to recreate it), then the entire cost would amount to between $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion using labor from the low wage or high wage country only, respectively. A pool of programmers across the globe could recreate all of OSS that is being widely used for a cost of approximately $8.80 trillion. Interpreting this number is\n\n19 Tables in the appendix show the equivalent values from Table 2 when including software language buckets 1 and 2 (Table A3) and all three software language buckets (Table A4).\n\nslightly more complicated but still feasible. According to a Statista (2023) report, global software revenue in 2020 (the same year as our data) was $531.7 billion. However, this represents a flow, not a stock, of software. Relying on government estimates that software fully depreciates over three years, we can do a back of the envelope calculation and consider the purchase value of the full stock of prepackaged software used in 2020 as the aggregate of that sold from 2018 to 2020, which is $1.54 trillion. Further, this represents only the expenditure on prepackaged software and does  not  include  custom  purchased  or  in-house  developed  software.  Here,  the  best  obtainable estimates of private-sector investment in software overall come from the United States National Income and Product Accounts data (NIPA 2023). In 2020, the national account data shows that in the  US,  private  firms  spent  $479.2  billion  on  software,  of  which  45%  ($215.5  billion)  was prepackaged. If we assume this is a consistent ratio for the rest of the world, then the total amount firms spent on software being used in 2020 was $3.4 trillion (= $1.54 trillion\/0.45). Combining this rough estimate with the demand side estimate of the value of OSS based on an average global wage ($8.8 trillion), this indicates firms would spend $12.2 trillion (=$3.4 trillion + $8.8 trillion), or three and a half times what they currently spend if they needed to pay in-house developers to write the OSS that they currently use for free.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"situational","seed_document_id":13,"situational_context":"A curious software developer is deep in research, trying to understand the immense value and economic impact of open-source software documented by Harvard Business School.","topic":"Others"}}

It is a highly flexible model that allows us to create non-linear transformations of lines of code to dollar-values.

To calculate a global wage, we include the base monthly salaries of software developers from Salary Expert for the top 30 countries in terms of their GitHub developer counts in 2021 (Wachs et al., 2022). 17 The weight of each country is its share of active GitHub contributors over the total contributors in the top 30 countries. We further create bounds by using a low-wage (India) and high-wage (USA) labor market for the wage to better understand how the value would vary by the pool of programmers used to recreate all of OSS. 18\n\nDocument 8: ## 3. Methodology\n\nWe first measure the value of OSS by considering the supply and the demand side of OSS using a labor market approach. 14 The thought experiment is that we live in a world where OSS does not exist and has to be recreated at each firm that uses a given piece of OSS. Using the labor market approach, we calculate the labor replacement cost of each OSS package. To estimate the value for each package, we use COCOMO II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) at the individual package level and then sum across all package values to obtain a supply-side labor market replacement value. Then, we scale the supply-side value by the number of times firms are using each package while removing multi-usage within each firm to obtain a demand-side value.\n\nSecond, we move beyond the aggregate and inspect inequality in the value creation process. In OSS, as with many creative endeavors, it is common that a small handful of individuals provide the bulk of the contributions, while many others make small contributions (sometimes referred to as the 80\/20 rule, implying 80% of the work is done by 20% of the people). Research has shown these frequent contributors often attain positions of influence in OSS communities as a result of their efforts (Hanisch, et al, 2018). Therefore, to better understand the dispersion of value creation across developers, we first use the GHTorrent data and identify individual developer contributions in two ways: a) through their OSS value contributions directly and b) through the total number of repositories they contributed to. We then test how concentrated these two contribution measures are to better understand whether many or few developers contribute to the total value we measure. We explain the exact details for the labor market approach and the inequality of valuations below.\n\nDocument 21: ## Appendix A) Goods-Market Valuation Approach\n\nAs an alternate estimation method, instead of using the labor replacement cost, we use a goods replacement value approach. We identify several OSS packages that have similar closed-source, pecuniary alternatives and consider the costs if all commercial users of the free OSS had to replace that software with a pecuniary alternative (similar to the calculations Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) performed for web servers). We can then use this alternate value of p , combined with the q values from above to estimate a goods replacement value of OSS. This method builds on suggestions from Nordhaus (2006, p. 146) who says '…the price of market and nonmarket goods and services should be imputed on the basis of the comparable market goods and services.' We do not expect the estimates from the two methods to be similar. Quite the contrary, the value of those two methods varies substantially since the latter goods-market approach assumes a fixed price to sell a good multiple times and that fixed price is usually lower than the total value estimated from recreating all packages on the labor side. The differential between these estimates is  essentially the result of a firm stepping in to reproduce the missing OSS packages and then selling them for a pecuniary price rather than all firms needing to reproduce those packages from scratch themselves.\n\nWith the goods market approach, the thought experiment is still that we live in a world where OSS does not exist, but it has to be recreated via one firm that then charges a price for a good that is currently free. To value OSS via the goods market approach, we created a basket of equivalent substitute proprietary goods that are priced on the open market as a stand-in for an OSS product.  This  methodology  is  consistent  with  that  used  in  the  prior  literature  (Greenstein  and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021) although both of those studies only used a single good rather than a basket since they were focused on only one type of OSS (web servers). Since there is no readily available database for proprietary equivalents of OSS, we conduct a search based on subjective  perception  of  popularity  of  OSS  and  we  then  search  for  pecuniary,  closed-source substitutes for them. The resulting basket of 20 OSS packages with proprietary substitutes is a good representation of the diversity of OSS. The software ranges from media and design software to statistical analysis programs, to database management and web server software. 21\n\n21 Table A5 shows the basket of OSS and their proprietary equivalents that we used. To create this basket, we looked for proprietary software that had an OSS equivalent that was similar in its overall function and feature set, and sought to identify pairs of software that, in aggregate, captured a broad and representative set of the types of OSS that exist.\n\nBased on our OSS equivalent substitute proprietary goods basket we then obtain prices for each proprietary software equivalent and we calculated the COCOMO labor market supply-side value for each OSS product in the basket which we use as a proxy - for lack of the code from the proprietary software - for the COCOMO labor supply side value of the proprietary software (e.g., the cost it would take to pay a programmer to write that proprietary software from scratch). We then calculate the average COCOMO labor supply-side value of the basket, 𝑉 !,1#23.4 ,  and  the average price for the basket, 𝑃 !,1#23.4 . 22 Since, we know the labor market supply-side value of all OSS, 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; , we can setup the following equation and obtain the price of OSS, 𝑃 ! for the goodsmarket for all OSS via a simple scaling transformation:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nThis results in the following goods-market supply-side value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nWe can then obtain the equivalent demand-side goods-market values as follows:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nFrom the goods market side, we consider the equivalent price that a firm would charge if it produced all existing widely used OSS and then sold it as a product to customers.\n\nTable A6, column 3 shows that the value on the demand side ranges between $177 million and $244 million across the different buckets independent of the country of origin from which programmers are hired. Naturally, the goods-market value will be substantially smaller than the labor demand value since this imaginary firm will make a profit at a comparatively low price by producing the software once and then selling it to many customers. Further, while Greenstein and Nagle (2014) as well as Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) focus on one particular type of software only (web servers), we attempt to expand on their approach to many goods. However, the data limitations become a stronger constraint in this context which makes it inherently more difficult\n\n22 We obtained the average price of the goods-market proprietary basket by using a 3 years lifespan of software, i.e. 1\/(1-0.66), so the depreciation factor is 0.33. This is consistent with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules for depreciating software, which states 'If you can depreciate the cost of computer software, use the straight line method over a useful life of 36 months.' https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/publications\/p946#en\\_US\\_2022\\_publink1000107354.\n\nto  estimate  the  value  through  this  approach  while  requiring  substantially  more  assumptions. Instead of a pure goods-market approach, this requires assistance from the labor-market approach in terms of scaling for the estimate, which ultimately leads to a substantial underestimate of the value of OSS. Further, the pricing strategy of the proprietary software counterparts is sensitive to the  market  demand.  With  the  goods-market  approach  extending  to  multiple  goods,  the  strong implicit assumption is that the market demands for our basket software and our sample OSS are similar, so they lead to commensurate prices.\n\nAn alternative and even more simplified goods-market back-of-the-envelope calculation that does not account for lines of code and relies on no scaling from the labor market approach would simply be to multiply a price of a reference good with the usage. We can take the minimum, average, and maximum prices of the basket of proprietary goods as captured in the reference price vector p = (69.99, 1610.17, 5800) and simply multiply it with usage from the combined Census and BuiltWith sample (Table 1). Based on those imputed proprietary price assumptions, the goods market demand side value would range from $0.2 - $16.5 trillion (minimum price - maximum price)  with  the  mean  price  resulting  in  a  value  estimate  of  $4.5  trillion.  However,  while  this estimate creates slightly more variance than the labor market approach, it is inherently flawed by simply assuming that the imputed prices are identical for each open source product based on the reference price. We further think this very simple back-of-the-envelope is an orange to apples comparison since the goods in our basket are fully functional, stand-alone software packages, while the packages in the Census and BuiltWith datasets are comprised of application libraries, which are generally smaller than such stand-alone packages.\n\nGiven all the complexities and assumptions one has to make due to lack of data for a goodsmarket approach, we place stronger emphasis on the labor cost approach highlighted in the main body but we include this method here for completeness.\n\nDocument 11: ## 4.

Could you explain how they determine this value?","reference_answer":"The methodology used to estimate the supply-side value of OSS is the labor market approach, which calculates the labor replacement cost of each OSS package using the Constructive Cost Model II (COCOMO II). This involves estimating the cost to reproduce the package by hiring a programmer and paying them a competitive market wage, and then summing these values across all packages.","reference_context":"Document 8: ## 3. Methodology\n\nWe first measure the value of OSS by considering the supply and the demand side of OSS using a labor market approach. 14 The thought experiment is that we live in a world where OSS does not exist and has to be recreated at each firm that uses a given piece of OSS. Using the labor market approach, we calculate the labor replacement cost of each OSS package. To estimate the value for each package, we use COCOMO II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) at the individual package level and then sum across all package values to obtain a supply-side labor market replacement value. Then, we scale the supply-side value by the number of times firms are using each package while removing multi-usage within each firm to obtain a demand-side value.\n\nSecond, we move beyond the aggregate and inspect inequality in the value creation process. In OSS, as with many creative endeavors, it is common that a small handful of individuals provide the bulk of the contributions, while many others make small contributions (sometimes referred to as the 80\/20 rule, implying 80% of the work is done by 20% of the people). Research has shown these frequent contributors often attain positions of influence in OSS communities as a result of their efforts (Hanisch, et al, 2018). Therefore, to better understand the dispersion of value creation across developers, we first use the GHTorrent data and identify individual developer contributions in two ways: a) through their OSS value contributions directly and b) through the total number of repositories they contributed to. We then test how concentrated these two contribution measures are to better understand whether many or few developers contribute to the total value we measure. We explain the exact details for the labor market approach and the inequality of valuations below.\n\nDocument 9: ## 3.1 Labor market approach\n\nFor the labor market approach, we estimate the value of OSS by calculating the replacement value of a package. We ask how much it would cost to reproduce the package by hiring a programmer and paying them a competitive market wage. To estimate this supply-side value ( 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; ) , we take the complete list of OSS packages discussed above, and then count the lines of code in each unique\n\n14 In an alternative version, we use a mixture of a labor and goods market approach that is more closely aligned with Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff, et al (2021). However, applying this method in our setting requires numerous additional assumptions due to data constraints. For simplicity we call it the goods market approach for which we provide the details and statistics, as well as the limitations in Appendix A.\n\npackage. 15 For each unique package,  , we calculate the value and then sum over all these values i to obtain the total value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nIn this calculation, we implicitly do not incorporate any production externalities since we assume that there is no spillover knowledge from one package to the next that would lower the cost of programming. 16 This methodology is similar to that used by other papers that estimate the supply-side costs of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021).\n\nWe then calculate the demand-side value of OSS by incorporating the usage information ( Q) for each package:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nHere, we do not incorporate consumption externalities, i.e., we do not allow a benefit to arise for the general public when a package has been created and we further make sure that each firm is only replacing a package they use once, since a replaced package can be used within a firm as a club good (e.g., see Cornes and Sandler, 1996). The value 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost to rewrite all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the concept of OSS still exists, but all of these packages needed to be rewritten from scratch), while the value 𝑉 + \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost for each firm that uses one of these OSS packages to pay a developer to rewrite those packages (e.g., OSS itself no longer exists).\n\nFor both the supply and demand models, we obtain the dollar-value for each package ( 𝑃 ( ) via the Constructive Cost Model II, also abbreviated as COCOMO II (Boehm 1984, Boehm et al. 2009). The model has previously been used by the United States Department of Defense to estimate software project costs as well as in prior research estimating the value of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021). It is a highly flexible model that allows us to create non-linear transformations of lines of code to dollar-values. It uses the following modelling equation:\n\n15 We use only the pure lines of code excluding documentation lines and empty lines. Hence, we underestimate the true value of recreating each package.\n\n16 Similar to a representative agent model (e.g. see Williamson 2006), one may think of each package being reproduced by separate programmers who are identical replicas of each other (and therefore have the same skill level, but do not become more efficient via learning).\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n( (\n\nwhere 𝐿 represents the lines of codes in thousands and E the effort in person-month units for each project  . Consistent with Blind et al. (2021), we use the default parameter values for i 𝛼 , 𝛽 and 𝜂. The parameters 𝛼 𝛽 , are non-linear adjustment factors set to 2.94, and 1.0997 respectively . The parameter 𝜂 is an effort-adjustment factor which can be modified to incorporate subjective assessments of product, hardware, personnel, and project attributes. Since we do not have a prior for each project, we set 𝜂 to the default value of one. To obtain the price ( 𝑃 ( ) of each OSS project, we  then  multiply  the  results  of  equation  (3)  by  the  weighted  global  wage  that  an  average programmer would obtain on the open market. To calculate a global wage, we include the base monthly salaries of software developers from Salary Expert for the top 30 countries in terms of their GitHub developer counts in 2021 (Wachs et al., 2022). 17 The weight of each country is its share of active GitHub contributors over the total contributors in the top 30 countries. We further create bounds by using a low-wage (India) and high-wage (USA) labor market for the wage to better understand how the value would vary by the pool of programmers used to recreate all of OSS. 18\n\nDocument 11: ## 4. Results\n\nAfter applying the labor market approach using COCOMO II, we obtain global estimates for the value of OSS. To calculate the overall value, we first need the underlying number of lines of code (to calculate the supply-side value) and then the usage statistics (for the demand-side value). Since there may be substantial heterogeneity in value by programming languages, we also show the top programming languages during our investigation period in the year 2020, as discussed above.\n\nDocument 21: ## Appendix A) Goods-Market Valuation Approach\n\nAs an alternate estimation method, instead of using the labor replacement cost, we use a goods replacement value approach. We identify several OSS packages that have similar closed-source, pecuniary alternatives and consider the costs if all commercial users of the free OSS had to replace that software with a pecuniary alternative (similar to the calculations Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) performed for web servers). We can then use this alternate value of p , combined with the q values from above to estimate a goods replacement value of OSS. This method builds on suggestions from Nordhaus (2006, p. 146) who says '…the price of market and nonmarket goods and services should be imputed on the basis of the comparable market goods and services.' We do not expect the estimates from the two methods to be similar. Quite the contrary, the value of those two methods varies substantially since the latter goods-market approach assumes a fixed price to sell a good multiple times and that fixed price is usually lower than the total value estimated from recreating all packages on the labor side. The differential between these estimates is  essentially the result of a firm stepping in to reproduce the missing OSS packages and then selling them for a pecuniary price rather than all firms needing to reproduce those packages from scratch themselves.\n\nWith the goods market approach, the thought experiment is still that we live in a world where OSS does not exist, but it has to be recreated via one firm that then charges a price for a good that is currently free. To value OSS via the goods market approach, we created a basket of equivalent substitute proprietary goods that are priced on the open market as a stand-in for an OSS product.  This  methodology  is  consistent  with  that  used  in  the  prior  literature  (Greenstein  and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021) although both of those studies only used a single good rather than a basket since they were focused on only one type of OSS (web servers). Since there is no readily available database for proprietary equivalents of OSS, we conduct a search based on subjective  perception  of  popularity  of  OSS  and  we  then  search  for  pecuniary,  closed-source substitutes for them. The resulting basket of 20 OSS packages with proprietary substitutes is a good representation of the diversity of OSS. The software ranges from media and design software to statistical analysis programs, to database management and web server software. 21\n\n21 Table A5 shows the basket of OSS and their proprietary equivalents that we used. To create this basket, we looked for proprietary software that had an OSS equivalent that was similar in its overall function and feature set, and sought to identify pairs of software that, in aggregate, captured a broad and representative set of the types of OSS that exist.\n\nBased on our OSS equivalent substitute proprietary goods basket we then obtain prices for each proprietary software equivalent and we calculated the COCOMO labor market supply-side value for each OSS product in the basket which we use as a proxy - for lack of the code from the proprietary software - for the COCOMO labor supply side value of the proprietary software (e.g., the cost it would take to pay a programmer to write that proprietary software from scratch). We then calculate the average COCOMO labor supply-side value of the basket, 𝑉 !,1#23.4 ,  and  the average price for the basket, 𝑃 !,1#23.4 . 22 Since, we know the labor market supply-side value of all OSS, 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; , we can setup the following equation and obtain the price of OSS, 𝑃 ! for the goodsmarket for all OSS via a simple scaling transformation:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nThis results in the following goods-market supply-side value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nWe can then obtain the equivalent demand-side goods-market values as follows:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nFrom the goods market side, we consider the equivalent price that a firm would charge if it produced all existing widely used OSS and then sold it as a product to customers.\n\nTable A6, column 3 shows that the value on the demand side ranges between $177 million and $244 million across the different buckets independent of the country of origin from which programmers are hired. Naturally, the goods-market value will be substantially smaller than the labor demand value since this imaginary firm will make a profit at a comparatively low price by producing the software once and then selling it to many customers. Further, while Greenstein and Nagle (2014) as well as Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) focus on one particular type of software only (web servers), we attempt to expand on their approach to many goods. However, the data limitations become a stronger constraint in this context which makes it inherently more difficult\n\n22 We obtained the average price of the goods-market proprietary basket by using a 3 years lifespan of software, i.e. 1\/(1-0.66), so the depreciation factor is 0.33. This is consistent with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules for depreciating software, which states 'If you can depreciate the cost of computer software, use the straight line method over a useful life of 36 months.' https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/publications\/p946#en\\_US\\_2022\\_publink1000107354.\n\nto  estimate  the  value  through  this  approach  while  requiring  substantially  more  assumptions. Instead of a pure goods-market approach, this requires assistance from the labor-market approach in terms of scaling for the estimate, which ultimately leads to a substantial underestimate of the value of OSS. Further, the pricing strategy of the proprietary software counterparts is sensitive to the  market  demand.  With  the  goods-market  approach  extending  to  multiple  goods,  the  strong implicit assumption is that the market demands for our basket software and our sample OSS are similar, so they lead to commensurate prices.\n\nAn alternative and even more simplified goods-market back-of-the-envelope calculation that does not account for lines of code and relies on no scaling from the labor market approach would simply be to multiply a price of a reference good with the usage. We can take the minimum, average, and maximum prices of the basket of proprietary goods as captured in the reference price vector p = (69.99, 1610.17, 5800) and simply multiply it with usage from the combined Census and BuiltWith sample (Table 1). Based on those imputed proprietary price assumptions, the goods market demand side value would range from $0.2 - $16.5 trillion (minimum price - maximum price)  with  the  mean  price  resulting  in  a  value  estimate  of  $4.5  trillion.  However,  while  this estimate creates slightly more variance than the labor market approach, it is inherently flawed by simply assuming that the imputed prices are identical for each open source product based on the reference price. We further think this very simple back-of-the-envelope is an orange to apples comparison since the goods in our basket are fully functional, stand-alone software packages, while the packages in the Census and BuiltWith datasets are comprised of application libraries, which are generally smaller than such stand-alone packages.\n\nGiven all the complexities and assumptions one has to make due to lack of data for a goodsmarket approach, we place stronger emphasis on the labor cost approach highlighted in the main body but we include this method here for completeness.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"situational","seed_document_id":8,"situational_context":"A technology entrepreneur, looking into ways to economically integrate Open Source Software (OSS) into his new startup, reads the OSS report from Harvard Business School to better understand the financial implications and potential savings of implementing OSS solutions instead of proprietary software.","topic":"Others"}}

Conclusion\n\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith. We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average value and distributed it across industries.\n\nIn this study we estimate the value of widely-used open source software globally with two unique datasets: the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data. We are able to estimate not only the supply side value of existing code (e.g., the cost it would take to rewrite each piece of widely-used OSS once) but also the demand side value for the private economy (e.g., the cost it would take for each company that uses a piece of OSS to rewrite it). While we do not focus on the long tail of OSS, we consider this an additional contribution of our study as focusing on OSS that is widely used allows us to more precisely understand the value created by OSS, rather than only measuring the  replacement  cost  for  all  OSS  (which  would  overestimate  the  true  value  since  many  OSS projects are not used in production code). However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n\nAdjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.  We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves.  Over  95%  percent  of  the  demand-side  value  is  generated  by  only  five  percent  of programmers, and those programmers contribute not only to a few widely used projects but to substantially more projects than the programmers that are engaged at the lower end of the value distribution.\n\nIn aggregate, our results show the substantial value that OSS contributes to the economy despite this value generally showing up as zero via direct measurement since prices equal zero and quantity is difficult to measure using public data alone. Our research lays the groundwork for future studies of not only OSS, but of all IT and its growing impact on the global economy.\n\nDocument 14: ## --- Figure 2 about here ---\n\nFigure 2 splits the OSS value estimates for each language by our inward facing (Census) and outward facing (BuiltWith) data sources. Panel A and Panel B focus on the supply and demand side estimation for the Census. We obtain a similar pattern that has been established already in the aggregate when pooling both data sources (Figure 1) albeit the impact of JavaScript is substantially lower.  On  the  supply  side  of  the  Census  in  Panel  A,  Java  has  the  second-highest  value  while JavaScript  code  from  the  Census  contributes  to  a  substantially  lower  value  to  the  aggregate. Similarly, the supply side values of C, Python, and Typescript are mainly driven by the Census. From the demand side Panel B we find that Go is the most popular language for inward facing code while all other languages appear to be negligible in relative terms.\n\nFigure 2, Panel C and Panel D show the supply and demand side values for the BuiltWith dataset. The supply side value in Panel C clearly indicates that the value from the BuiltWith sample is driven by JavaScript code, which is a good sanity check since we focused on JavaScript packages to proxy for OSS in the BuiltWith sample, as discussed above. The second highest value is created by TypeScript which is reassuring since it is a superset of JavaScript. Panel D shows a similar pattern  on  the  usage  side  where  most  of  the  value  arises  from  JavaScript  while  TypeScript  is trailing at the second spot as well. The other languages contribute only marginal amounts to the supply and demand side values. Overall, these findings are broadly consistent with the main use cases of the various languages (web programming vs. application programming) and an idea that languages through which value are generated are not necessarily identical to languages that are used by the general public.\n\n--- Figure 3 about here ---\n\nFigure 3 shows the demand-side value of OSS across industries by NAICS 2-digit codes using the BuiltWith online data. 20 This can be interpreted as the value each of these industries receive because OSS exists. The industry with the highest usage value of around $43 billion is 'Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.' 'Retail Trade' as well as 'Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services' make up another large part of the demand-side externally facing value of OSS with $36 billion and $35 billion, respectively. In contrast, industries that constitute just a small portion of the value are 'Mining, Quarrying, and Oil  and  Gas  Extraction',  'Utilities',  'Agriculture,  Forestry,  Fishing,  and  Hunting.'  The  latter industries are classical non-service sector industries and as such software is expected to play less of a role there.\n\nDocument 12: ## --- Table 1 about here ---\n\nTable  1  shows  descriptive  statistics  from  both  data  sets  separately.  The  inward-facing Census  (Panel  A)  contains  just  over  261.7  million  lines  of  code  with  72%  of  the  lines  being attributable to the top programming languages. The average package includes 142 thousand lines of code with a slightly lower average of 113 thousand lines of code for the subset of top languages. When considering the demand (usage) side, we observe that the Census packages were used over 2.7 million times while 92% of this usage is attributable to the top languages. The average package was used 1,472.4 times with a higher usage of around 1,497.5 for the top  languages.  For  the outward-facing  BuiltWith  data  we  find  similar  patterns,  but  at  different  levels.  The  packages included from BuiltWith include over 82 million lines of code, 71% of which are attributable to the  top  programming  languages.  The  average  package  within  the  BuiltWith  sample  has  111 thousand  lines  of  code  with  a  lower  average  of  around  80  thousand  lines  of  code  for  the  top languages. This is because our BuiltWith data primarily consists of JavaScript-based packages, which are often smaller than packages written in other languages. BuiltWith packages were used over 142 thousand times where 99.97% were attributable to the top languages. Next, we used these raw observations to calculate the value of all OSS through the labor market approach and estimated the value created from the supply and demand side.\n\n--- Table 2 about here ---\n\nTable 2 shows the estimates for the value of OSS based on the firm-relevant joint Census and BuiltWith sample. All estimates in Table 2 are based only on software languages classified in bucket  1  from  Table  A1,  which  are  the  most  likely  to  be  written  by  a  human  rather  than  a machine. 19 The first column contains estimates with wages from a low income country (India), the global  average  wage,  and  a  high  income  country  (United  States  of  America),  respectively  (as described above). To reproduce all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the idea of OSS still exists, but all current OSS is deleted and needs to be coded from scratch), using programmers at the average developer wage from India, it would require an investment of $1.22 billion. In contrast, if we use the average developer wage from the United States, then reproducing all widely-used OSS would require  an  investment  of  $6.22  billion.  Using  a  pool  of  programmers  from  across  the  world, weighed based on the existing geographic contributions to OSS as discussed above, would lead to an investment somewhere in between the low and high-income country, $4.15 billion. It is useful to compare these numbers to those from similar studies to understand differences in valuing all OSS (prior studies) versus that which is widely used (our study). Robbins et al. (2021) and Blind et al. (2021) use a method similar to ours and estimate that the value of OSS created in the US is $38 billion in 2019 and that created in the EU is €1 billion in 2018. Wachs et al. (2022) show that roughly 50% of OSS contributions come from the US and EU combined. In aggregate, that would lead these studies to give a global value of OSS of $78 billion. Thus, our middle estimate of a supply-side value of $4.15 billion for only firm-oriented and widely used OSS is a credible lowerbound and highlights the higher estimations of the total of supply-side value of OSS when not considering whether or not a given OSS package is widely used. This further indicates that the supply-side value of the most widely used OSS is roughly 5.5% of the supply-side value of all OSS.\n\nThe second column in Table 2 contains the demand side estimates based on the labor market approach. We find that if firms had to recreate all OSS packages they used (e.g., OSS itself no longer existed and every firm that used an OSS package had to recreate it), then the entire cost would amount to between $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion using labor from the low wage or high wage country only, respectively. A pool of programmers across the globe could recreate all of OSS that is being widely used for a cost of approximately $8.80 trillion. Interpreting this number is\n\n19 Tables in the appendix show the equivalent values from Table 2 when including software language buckets 1 and 2 (Table A3) and all three software language buckets (Table A4).\n\nslightly more complicated but still feasible. According to a Statista (2023) report, global software revenue in 2020 (the same year as our data) was $531.7 billion. However, this represents a flow, not a stock, of software. Relying on government estimates that software fully depreciates over three years, we can do a back of the envelope calculation and consider the purchase value of the full stock of prepackaged software used in 2020 as the aggregate of that sold from 2018 to 2020, which is $1.54 trillion. Further, this represents only the expenditure on prepackaged software and does  not  include  custom  purchased  or  in-house  developed  software.  Here,  the  best  obtainable estimates of private-sector investment in software overall come from the United States National Income and Product Accounts data (NIPA 2023). In 2020, the national account data shows that in the  US,  private  firms  spent  $479.2  billion  on  software,  of  which  45%  ($215.5  billion)  was prepackaged. If we assume this is a consistent ratio for the rest of the world, then the total amount firms spent on software being used in 2020 was $3.4 trillion (= $1.54 trillion\/0.45). Combining this rough estimate with the demand side estimate of the value of OSS based on an average global wage ($8.8 trillion), this indicates firms would spend $12.2 trillion (=$3.4 trillion + $8.8 trillion), or three and a half times what they currently spend if they needed to pay in-house developers to write the OSS that they currently use for free.\n\nDocument 6: ## 1. Introduction\n\nIn 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that 'software is eating the world' (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that 'open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,' (Jacks, 2022). Other recent studies have come to similar conclusions showing that open source software  (OSS)  -  software  whose  source  code  is  publicly  available  for  inspection,  use,  and modification and is often created in a decentralized manner and distributed for free - appears in 96% of codebases (Synopsys 2023), and that some commercial software consists of up to 99.9% freely available OSS (Musseau et al., 2022). Although in its early days OSS frequently copied features from existing proprietary software, OSS today includes cutting edge technology in various fields including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, big data, and analytics.  However, despite the increasing importance of OSS to all software (and therefore to the entire economy), measuring its impact has been elusive. Traditionally, to measure the value created by a good or service,  economists  multiply  the  price  ( p )  times  the  quantity  sold  ( q ).  However,  in  OSS, p is generally zero since the source code is publicly available, and q is  unknown due to the limited number of restrictions around how the code may be copied and reused. For example, if a company downloads  a  piece  of  OSS  from  a  public  code  repository,  it  may  copy  it  thousands  of  times internally (legally) and then share it with suppliers or customers (also legally), so public download data is insufficient. Although some recent studies have sought to estimate the value of p (discussed below), data for estimating q has been unavailable or intractable for anything more than just a handful of OSS packages. Using newly collected data from multiple sources, the goal of this paper is to provide estimates for both p and q and to use those to shine light on the question: What is the value of open source software?\n\nUnderstanding the value of OSS is of critical importance not only due to the role it plays in the economy, but also due to it being one of the most successful and impactful modern examples of the centuries old economic concept of 'the commons' which run the risk of meeting the fate known as 'the tragedy of the commons.' This concept can trace its roots as far back as the 4 th -century BC philosopher Aristotle who wrote 'That which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care. Men pay most attention to what is their own and care less for what is common.'  (Aristotle,  1981).  William  Forster  Lloyd  (1833)  resurfaced  the  idea  in  modern economic thought by highlighting the example of shared tracts of land used for cattle grazing by\n\nmultiple cattle herders who each had an incentive to overuse the shared resource. Garrett Hardin (1968)  brought  the  concept  into  the  broader  zeitgeist  when  he  wrote  an  article  discussing  the problem entitled 'The Tragedy of the Commons.' Building on this work, Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for her research highlighting paths to avoiding the tragedy of the commons through community coordination efforts that did not necessitate government enforced laws to manage and guard the commons (Ostrom 1990). The parallels between shared grazing lands and shared digital infrastructure are palpable - the availability of communal grass to feed cattle, and in turn feed people, was critical to the agrarian economy, and the ability to not have to recreate code that someone else has already written is critical to the modern economy. Further, in both contexts, despite knowing grass and code are critical inputs to the economy, measuring their actual value is difficult. And, as the renowned mathematician and physicist Lord Kelvin is believed to have said, 'If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.' And if you cannot improve and maintain it, such common goods may crumble under the weight of their own success as they are overused, but underinvested in (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021). Therefore, measuring the value OSS creates is crucial to the future health of the digital economy, and the rest of the economy that is built on top of it.\n\nImportantly, recent studies have attempted to address these measurement issues but fall short of capturing both the breadth and depth of OSS usage - a gap we seek to fill with this paper. For example, researchers have attempted to gain breadth by using novel methodologies to estimate the labor replacement value of the current corpus of OSS created in the United States at $38 billion in 2019 (Robbins et al., 2021) and that created in the European Union at €1 billion (Blind et al., 2021) by imputing the labor costs that it would have taken to rewrite existing OSS. Such efforts do a very good job at estimating what it would cost to replace all existing OSS if it disappeared tomorrow. However, the resultant estimates rely on two important assumptions. First, that all OSS is equally valuable from a usage standpoint, and second that the concept of OSS would still exist, and society would just need to rewrite the code once, thus addressing the aforementioned problem of a missing value for p , but not addressing the missing value of q . In a world where OSS did not exist at all, then each piece of OSS software would not need to be rewritten just once, but instead would need to be rewritten by every firm that used the software (assuming the firm could freely share the software within its boundaries). Other research (Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; MurcianoGoroff, Zhuo, and Greenstein, 2021) has gone deeper into this hypothetical, albeit in a narrow\n\nmanner, by only focusing on web servers (which are public facing on the Internet and can therefore be readily measured). Using different methods, both studies measure q for this one type of software and impute p by using a goods replacement value approach based on the prices for closed-source alternatives offered by firms. With data from the United States the resulting estimates show a value of  $2  billion  for  the  OSS  Apache  Web  Server  in  2012  (Greenstein  and  Nagle,  2014)  and  a combined value of $4.5 billion for Apache and the increasingly popular OSS web server nginx in 2018 (Murciano-Goroff, et al., 2021). However, although web servers are an important part of the OSS  ecosystem,  they  constitute  a  small  portion  of  it.  We  seek  to  build  upon  the  important contributions this existing research has made in an attempt to go both broad and deep to create a more complete measure of the value of OSS.\n\nTo consider the value of OSS in both a broad and deep manner, we use data from two primary sources that allow us to gain insights into the OSS used at tens of thousands of firms across the world. The first is the 'Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries' (Nagle et al., 2022). The Census II project utilized partnerships with multiple software composition analysis (SCA) firms to create various lists of the most widely used OSS. SCAs are hired to scan the codebases of a company to ensure they are not violating any OSS licenses and, as a byproduct, track all the OSS code used by their customers and the products they build. The Census II project aggregated data from multiple SCAs to build a dataset of OSS usage at tens of thousands of firms based  on  millions  of  data  points  (observations  of  OSS  usage).  The  second  data  source  is  the BuiltWith dataset, from which we leverage scans of nearly nine million websites to identify the underlying technology deployed by these websites, including OSS libraries. The BuiltWith data has been used in multiple academic studies (DeStefano &amp; Timmis 2023, Dushnitsky &amp; Stroube 2021, Koning et al.. 2022), but to our knowledge this is the first one to focus on OSS usage. The Census II data and the BuiltWith data are complementary as the former focuses on OSS that is built  into  the  software  a  company  sells,  while  the  latter  focuses  on  OSS  that  is  built  into  a company's website, thus reducing the chances of double-counting observations across the datasets. In aggregate, these two datasets combined create the most complete measurement of OSS usage ( q ) to date. Further, by focusing on OSS that is widely deployed and used by firms, rather than considering all the projects that exist in an OSS repository, we enhance the methodologies of prior studies by reducing the likelihood of measurement error stemming from projects that are posted as publicly available OSS but are not actually used in any practical manner. Not accounting for this\n\nmeasurement error would lead to overestimation of the actual value of OSS as projects that are widely used would be valued in the same way as projects that are not used at all.\n\nTo estimate p ,  we  follow  the  literature  discussed  above  and  use  the  labor  replacement value. First, we calculate the labor cost it would take an individual firm to recreate a given OSS package by measuring the number of lines of code within the package and then applying the Constructive Cost Model II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) - also known as COCOMO II to estimate the number of person-hours it would take to write the code from scratch. We then utilize global wage data from Salary Expert to get an accurate estimate of the labor costs a firm would incur if this piece of OSS did not exist. These costs can be combined with the q values from above at the OSS package level to estimate the combined value of all OSS from both the supply and demand sides.\n\nWe find a value ranging from $1.22 billion to $6.22 billion if we were to decide as a society to recreate all widely used OSS on the supply side. However, considering the actual usage of OSS leads to a demand-side value that is orders of magnitude larger and ranges from $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion, if each firm who used an OSS package had to recreate it from scratch (e.g., the concept of OSS did not exist). We document substantial heterogeneity of the value of OSS by programming  language  and  internal  vs  outward-facing  programming  efforts.  Further,  we  find considerable  heterogeneity  in  value  contributions  by  programmers  as  5%  of  programmers  are responsible for more than 90% of the value created on the supply- and demand- side. The data we use is arguably the most comprehensive source of data to measure the value created by firm usage of OSS at this time. However, as for any project, the evidence is not complete and we argue that we underestimate the value since our data, e.g., does not include operating systems, which are a substantial omitted category of OSS.\n\nThis study makes four important contributions to the academic literature, practitioners, and policy makers. First, it provides the most complete estimate of the value of widely used OSS to date  by  accounting  for  not  only  the  supply-side  of  OSS  (price  to  create  it),  but  also  for  the usage\/demand-side at a scale that has not been done before. While prior estimates of the value of OSS only went either broad (estimating the supply-side costs of a large swath of OSS) or deep (estimating the value created by one particular type of OSS), this study does both by using unique datasets that allow for a better understanding of the breadth and depth of OSS usage. Further, rather than measuring the value of all OSS, this study focuses on the value of OSS that is used by firms\n\nto create its products and websites, limiting the measurement error occurring in studies that are unable to account for which OSS is actually used in production. This contribution builds upon, and extends, important research (e.g., Blind et al., 2021; Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021; Robbins et al., 2021) that has sought to identify the value of this vital resource that contributes a great deal to the modern economy despite the difficulties measuring this contribution. In  doing  so,  it  adds  insights  to  a  long-running  discussion  related  to  the  impact  of  information technology (IT) on productivity (Brynjolfsson, 1993; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 1996; Nagle, 2019a; Solow, 1987) known as the 'productivity paradox' where IT investments can have limited impact on productivity statistics. This debate has continued into the emerging context of AI (Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson, 2018). Our work contributes to this conversation by highlighting a massive societal level cost-savings (and hence productivity enhancement) that is created by the existence of OSS.\n\nSecond, our research contributes methodological advances to the study of intangible capital by highlighting novel sources of data related to investments in OSS. Prior research has shown that intangible capital plays an increasingly important role in economic growth (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel,  2009)  and  firm  value  (Peters  and  Taylor,  2017),  but  it  often  goes  unmeasured  or misattributed (Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou, 2014). Further, we demonstrate how these data sources can be used to understand the true investments in software that a firm makes, and that which they would have to make if OSS did not exist.  This  is  valuable  as  investments  in  software  are  an increasingly important type of intangible capital that is driving innovation (Branstetter, Drev, and Kwon, 2019) and performance (Krishnan et al., 2000).\n\nThird, our results help highlight for firms and managers the importance of OSS to their production, and ideally add weight to arguments that users of OSS should not just free ride but also contribute to the creation and maintenance of OSS (e.g., Henkel, 2008; Nagle, 2018). Such contributions are a fraction of the costs that firms would incur if OSS did not exist and the active participation of OSS users in helping maintain the OSS they use is critical to the health and future well-being of the OSS ecosystem (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021; Zhang et al., 2019).\n\nFourth,  and  finally,  our  study  helps  inform  policymakers  who  have  recently  started  to understand  the  growing  importance  of  OSS  to  the  economy  and  taken  actions  to  support  the ecosystem (European Commission, 2020; Executive Order No. 14028, 2021). However, most of these efforts are related to securing the existing OSS ecosystem, which is quite important, but do\n\nnot go as far as supporting the creation of new OSS. Our results help shine light on the importance of OSS to the overall economy and add weight to calls for more societal support of this critical resource. Our results further show that the majority of the value created by OSS is created by a small  number  of  contributors.  Although  it  has  long  been  known  that  a  small  number  of  OSS contributors do most of the work, we add new insights that show this is even more true for the value creation of widely-used OSS projects and that societal support for these individuals is critical to the future success of OSS, and in turn, the economy.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

The labor market approach estimates the value by calculating the replacement cost of a package through hiring programmers at competitive wages, using COCOMO II to estimate supply-side value based on lines of code and demand-side value by incorporating usage information, without accounting for externalities.","reference_context":"Document 21: ## Appendix A) Goods-Market Valuation Approach\n\nAs an alternate estimation method, instead of using the labor replacement cost, we use a goods replacement value approach. We identify several OSS packages that have similar closed-source, pecuniary alternatives and consider the costs if all commercial users of the free OSS had to replace that software with a pecuniary alternative (similar to the calculations Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) performed for web servers). We can then use this alternate value of p , combined with the q values from above to estimate a goods replacement value of OSS. This method builds on suggestions from Nordhaus (2006, p. 146) who says '…the price of market and nonmarket goods and services should be imputed on the basis of the comparable market goods and services.' We do not expect the estimates from the two methods to be similar. Quite the contrary, the value of those two methods varies substantially since the latter goods-market approach assumes a fixed price to sell a good multiple times and that fixed price is usually lower than the total value estimated from recreating all packages on the labor side. The differential between these estimates is  essentially the result of a firm stepping in to reproduce the missing OSS packages and then selling them for a pecuniary price rather than all firms needing to reproduce those packages from scratch themselves.\n\nWith the goods market approach, the thought experiment is still that we live in a world where OSS does not exist, but it has to be recreated via one firm that then charges a price for a good that is currently free. To value OSS via the goods market approach, we created a basket of equivalent substitute proprietary goods that are priced on the open market as a stand-in for an OSS product.  This  methodology  is  consistent  with  that  used  in  the  prior  literature  (Greenstein  and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021) although both of those studies only used a single good rather than a basket since they were focused on only one type of OSS (web servers). Since there is no readily available database for proprietary equivalents of OSS, we conduct a search based on subjective  perception  of  popularity  of  OSS  and  we  then  search  for  pecuniary,  closed-source substitutes for them. The resulting basket of 20 OSS packages with proprietary substitutes is a good representation of the diversity of OSS. The software ranges from media and design software to statistical analysis programs, to database management and web server software. 21\n\n21 Table A5 shows the basket of OSS and their proprietary equivalents that we used. To create this basket, we looked for proprietary software that had an OSS equivalent that was similar in its overall function and feature set, and sought to identify pairs of software that, in aggregate, captured a broad and representative set of the types of OSS that exist.\n\nBased on our OSS equivalent substitute proprietary goods basket we then obtain prices for each proprietary software equivalent and we calculated the COCOMO labor market supply-side value for each OSS product in the basket which we use as a proxy - for lack of the code from the proprietary software - for the COCOMO labor supply side value of the proprietary software (e.g., the cost it would take to pay a programmer to write that proprietary software from scratch). We then calculate the average COCOMO labor supply-side value of the basket, 𝑉 !,1#23.4 ,  and  the average price for the basket, 𝑃 !,1#23.4 . 22 Since, we know the labor market supply-side value of all OSS, 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; , we can setup the following equation and obtain the price of OSS, 𝑃 ! for the goodsmarket for all OSS via a simple scaling transformation:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nThis results in the following goods-market supply-side value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nWe can then obtain the equivalent demand-side goods-market values as follows:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nFrom the goods market side, we consider the equivalent price that a firm would charge if it produced all existing widely used OSS and then sold it as a product to customers.\n\nTable A6, column 3 shows that the value on the demand side ranges between $177 million and $244 million across the different buckets independent of the country of origin from which programmers are hired. Naturally, the goods-market value will be substantially smaller than the labor demand value since this imaginary firm will make a profit at a comparatively low price by producing the software once and then selling it to many customers. Further, while Greenstein and Nagle (2014) as well as Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) focus on one particular type of software only (web servers), we attempt to expand on their approach to many goods. However, the data limitations become a stronger constraint in this context which makes it inherently more difficult\n\n22 We obtained the average price of the goods-market proprietary basket by using a 3 years lifespan of software, i.e. 1\/(1-0.66), so the depreciation factor is 0.33. This is consistent with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules for depreciating software, which states 'If you can depreciate the cost of computer software, use the straight line method over a useful life of 36 months.' https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/publications\/p946#en\\_US\\_2022\\_publink1000107354.\n\nto  estimate  the  value  through  this  approach  while  requiring  substantially  more  assumptions. Instead of a pure goods-market approach, this requires assistance from the labor-market approach in terms of scaling for the estimate, which ultimately leads to a substantial underestimate of the value of OSS. Further, the pricing strategy of the proprietary software counterparts is sensitive to the  market  demand.  With  the  goods-market  approach  extending  to  multiple  goods,  the  strong implicit assumption is that the market demands for our basket software and our sample OSS are similar, so they lead to commensurate prices.\n\nAn alternative and even more simplified goods-market back-of-the-envelope calculation that does not account for lines of code and relies on no scaling from the labor market approach would simply be to multiply a price of a reference good with the usage. We can take the minimum, average, and maximum prices of the basket of proprietary goods as captured in the reference price vector p = (69.99, 1610.17, 5800) and simply multiply it with usage from the combined Census and BuiltWith sample (Table 1). Based on those imputed proprietary price assumptions, the goods market demand side value would range from $0.2 - $16.5 trillion (minimum price - maximum price)  with  the  mean  price  resulting  in  a  value  estimate  of  $4.5  trillion.  However,  while  this estimate creates slightly more variance than the labor market approach, it is inherently flawed by simply assuming that the imputed prices are identical for each open source product based on the reference price. We further think this very simple back-of-the-envelope is an orange to apples comparison since the goods in our basket are fully functional, stand-alone software packages, while the packages in the Census and BuiltWith datasets are comprised of application libraries, which are generally smaller than such stand-alone packages.\n\nGiven all the complexities and assumptions one has to make due to lack of data for a goodsmarket approach, we place stronger emphasis on the labor cost approach highlighted in the main body but we include this method here for completeness.\n\nDocument 9: ## 3.1 Labor market approach\n\nFor the labor market approach, we estimate the value of OSS by calculating the replacement value of a package. We ask how much it would cost to reproduce the package by hiring a programmer and paying them a competitive market wage. To estimate this supply-side value ( 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; ) , we take the complete list of OSS packages discussed above, and then count the lines of code in each unique\n\n14 In an alternative version, we use a mixture of a labor and goods market approach that is more closely aligned with Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff, et al (2021). However, applying this method in our setting requires numerous additional assumptions due to data constraints. For simplicity we call it the goods market approach for which we provide the details and statistics, as well as the limitations in Appendix A.\n\npackage. 15 For each unique package,  , we calculate the value and then sum over all these values i to obtain the total value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nIn this calculation, we implicitly do not incorporate any production externalities since we assume that there is no spillover knowledge from one package to the next that would lower the cost of programming. 16 This methodology is similar to that used by other papers that estimate the supply-side costs of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021).\n\nWe then calculate the demand-side value of OSS by incorporating the usage information ( Q) for each package:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nHere, we do not incorporate consumption externalities, i.e., we do not allow a benefit to arise for the general public when a package has been created and we further make sure that each firm is only replacing a package they use once, since a replaced package can be used within a firm as a club good (e.g., see Cornes and Sandler, 1996). The value 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost to rewrite all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the concept of OSS still exists, but all of these packages needed to be rewritten from scratch), while the value 𝑉 + \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost for each firm that uses one of these OSS packages to pay a developer to rewrite those packages (e.g., OSS itself no longer exists).\n\nFor both the supply and demand models, we obtain the dollar-value for each package ( 𝑃 ( ) via the Constructive Cost Model II, also abbreviated as COCOMO II (Boehm 1984, Boehm et al. 2009). The model has previously been used by the United States Department of Defense to estimate software project costs as well as in prior research estimating the value of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021). It is a highly flexible model that allows us to create non-linear transformations of lines of code to dollar-values. It uses the following modelling equation:\n\n15 We use only the pure lines of code excluding documentation lines and empty lines. Hence, we underestimate the true value of recreating each package.\n\n16 Similar to a representative agent model (e.g. see Williamson 2006), one may think of each package being reproduced by separate programmers who are identical replicas of each other (and therefore have the same skill level, but do not become more efficient via learning).\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n( (\n\nwhere 𝐿 represents the lines of codes in thousands and E the effort in person-month units for each project  . Consistent with Blind et al. (2021), we use the default parameter values for i 𝛼 , 𝛽 and 𝜂. The parameters 𝛼 𝛽 , are non-linear adjustment factors set to 2.94, and 1.0997 respectively . The parameter 𝜂 is an effort-adjustment factor which can be modified to incorporate subjective assessments of product, hardware, personnel, and project attributes. Since we do not have a prior for each project, we set 𝜂 to the default value of one. To obtain the price ( 𝑃 ( ) of each OSS project, we  then  multiply  the  results  of  equation  (3)  by  the  weighted  global  wage  that  an  average programmer would obtain on the open market. To calculate a global wage, we include the base monthly salaries of software developers from Salary Expert for the top 30 countries in terms of their GitHub developer counts in 2021 (Wachs et al., 2022). 17 The weight of each country is its share of active GitHub contributors over the total contributors in the top 30 countries. We further create bounds by using a low-wage (India) and high-wage (USA) labor market for the wage to better understand how the value would vary by the pool of programmers used to recreate all of OSS. 18\n\nDocument 8: ## 3. Methodology\n\nWe first measure the value of OSS by considering the supply and the demand side of OSS using a labor market approach. 14 The thought experiment is that we live in a world where OSS does not exist and has to be recreated at each firm that uses a given piece of OSS. Using the labor market approach, we calculate the labor replacement cost of each OSS package. To estimate the value for each package, we use COCOMO II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) at the individual package level and then sum across all package values to obtain a supply-side labor market replacement value. Then, we scale the supply-side value by the number of times firms are using each package while removing multi-usage within each firm to obtain a demand-side value.\n\nSecond, we move beyond the aggregate and inspect inequality in the value creation process. In OSS, as with many creative endeavors, it is common that a small handful of individuals provide the bulk of the contributions, while many others make small contributions (sometimes referred to as the 80\/20 rule, implying 80% of the work is done by 20% of the people). Research has shown these frequent contributors often attain positions of influence in OSS communities as a result of their efforts (Hanisch, et al, 2018). Therefore, to better understand the dispersion of value creation across developers, we first use the GHTorrent data and identify individual developer contributions in two ways: a) through their OSS value contributions directly and b) through the total number of repositories they contributed to. We then test how concentrated these two contribution measures are to better understand whether many or few developers contribute to the total value we measure. We explain the exact details for the labor market approach and the inequality of valuations below.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"double","original_questions":[{"question":"What is the goods-market valuation approach for estimating the value of Open Source Software (OSS) according to the Harvard Business School's OSS report?","answer":"The goods-market valuation approach estimates the value of OSS by considering the costs if all commercial users of the free OSS had to replace that software with pecuniary alternatives.

Introduction\n\nIn 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that 'software is eating the world' (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that 'open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,' (Jacks, 2022). Other recent studies have come to similar conclusions showing that open source software  (OSS)  -  software  whose  source  code  is  publicly  available  for  inspection,  use,  and modification and is often created in a decentralized manner and distributed for free - appears in 96% of codebases (Synopsys 2023), and that some commercial software consists of up to 99.9% freely available OSS (Musseau et al., 2022). Although in its early days OSS frequently copied features from existing proprietary software, OSS today includes cutting edge technology in various fields including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, big data, and analytics.  However, despite the increasing importance of OSS to all software (and therefore to the entire economy), measuring its impact has been elusive. Traditionally, to measure the value created by a good or service,  economists  multiply  the  price  ( p )  times  the  quantity  sold  ( q ).  However,  in  OSS, p is generally zero since the source code is publicly available, and q is  unknown due to the limited number of restrictions around how the code may be copied and reused. For example, if a company downloads  a  piece  of  OSS  from  a  public  code  repository,  it  may  copy  it  thousands  of  times internally (legally) and then share it with suppliers or customers (also legally), so public download data is insufficient. Although some recent studies have sought to estimate the value of p (discussed below), data for estimating q has been unavailable or intractable for anything more than just a handful of OSS packages. Using newly collected data from multiple sources, the goal of this paper is to provide estimates for both p and q and to use those to shine light on the question: What is the value of open source software?\n\nUnderstanding the value of OSS is of critical importance not only due to the role it plays in the economy, but also due to it being one of the most successful and impactful modern examples of the centuries old economic concept of 'the commons' which run the risk of meeting the fate known as 'the tragedy of the commons.' This concept can trace its roots as far back as the 4 th -century BC philosopher Aristotle who wrote 'That which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care. Men pay most attention to what is their own and care less for what is common.'  (Aristotle,  1981).  William  Forster  Lloyd  (1833)  resurfaced  the  idea  in  modern economic thought by highlighting the example of shared tracts of land used for cattle grazing by\n\nmultiple cattle herders who each had an incentive to overuse the shared resource. Garrett Hardin (1968)  brought  the  concept  into  the  broader  zeitgeist  when  he  wrote  an  article  discussing  the problem entitled 'The Tragedy of the Commons.' Building on this work, Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for her research highlighting paths to avoiding the tragedy of the commons through community coordination efforts that did not necessitate government enforced laws to manage and guard the commons (Ostrom 1990). The parallels between shared grazing lands and shared digital infrastructure are palpable - the availability of communal grass to feed cattle, and in turn feed people, was critical to the agrarian economy, and the ability to not have to recreate code that someone else has already written is critical to the modern economy. Further, in both contexts, despite knowing grass and code are critical inputs to the economy, measuring their actual value is difficult. And, as the renowned mathematician and physicist Lord Kelvin is believed to have said, 'If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.' And if you cannot improve and maintain it, such common goods may crumble under the weight of their own success as they are overused, but underinvested in (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021). Therefore, measuring the value OSS creates is crucial to the future health of the digital economy, and the rest of the economy that is built on top of it.\n\nImportantly, recent studies have attempted to address these measurement issues but fall short of capturing both the breadth and depth of OSS usage - a gap we seek to fill with this paper. For example, researchers have attempted to gain breadth by using novel methodologies to estimate the labor replacement value of the current corpus of OSS created in the United States at $38 billion in 2019 (Robbins et al., 2021) and that created in the European Union at €1 billion (Blind et al., 2021) by imputing the labor costs that it would have taken to rewrite existing OSS. Such efforts do a very good job at estimating what it would cost to replace all existing OSS if it disappeared tomorrow. However, the resultant estimates rely on two important assumptions. First, that all OSS is equally valuable from a usage standpoint, and second that the concept of OSS would still exist, and society would just need to rewrite the code once, thus addressing the aforementioned problem of a missing value for p , but not addressing the missing value of q . In a world where OSS did not exist at all, then each piece of OSS software would not need to be rewritten just once, but instead would need to be rewritten by every firm that used the software (assuming the firm could freely share the software within its boundaries). Other research (Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; MurcianoGoroff, Zhuo, and Greenstein, 2021) has gone deeper into this hypothetical, albeit in a narrow\n\nmanner, by only focusing on web servers (which are public facing on the Internet and can therefore be readily measured). Using different methods, both studies measure q for this one type of software and impute p by using a goods replacement value approach based on the prices for closed-source alternatives offered by firms. With data from the United States the resulting estimates show a value of  $2  billion  for  the  OSS  Apache  Web  Server  in  2012  (Greenstein  and  Nagle,  2014)  and  a combined value of $4.5 billion for Apache and the increasingly popular OSS web server nginx in 2018 (Murciano-Goroff, et al., 2021). However, although web servers are an important part of the OSS  ecosystem,  they  constitute  a  small  portion  of  it.  We  seek  to  build  upon  the  important contributions this existing research has made in an attempt to go both broad and deep to create a more complete measure of the value of OSS.\n\nTo consider the value of OSS in both a broad and deep manner, we use data from two primary sources that allow us to gain insights into the OSS used at tens of thousands of firms across the world. The first is the 'Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries' (Nagle et al., 2022). The Census II project utilized partnerships with multiple software composition analysis (SCA) firms to create various lists of the most widely used OSS. SCAs are hired to scan the codebases of a company to ensure they are not violating any OSS licenses and, as a byproduct, track all the OSS code used by their customers and the products they build. The Census II project aggregated data from multiple SCAs to build a dataset of OSS usage at tens of thousands of firms based  on  millions  of  data  points  (observations  of  OSS  usage).  The  second  data  source  is  the BuiltWith dataset, from which we leverage scans of nearly nine million websites to identify the underlying technology deployed by these websites, including OSS libraries. The BuiltWith data has been used in multiple academic studies (DeStefano &amp; Timmis 2023, Dushnitsky &amp; Stroube 2021, Koning et al.. 2022), but to our knowledge this is the first one to focus on OSS usage. The Census II data and the BuiltWith data are complementary as the former focuses on OSS that is built  into  the  software  a  company  sells,  while  the  latter  focuses  on  OSS  that  is  built  into  a company's website, thus reducing the chances of double-counting observations across the datasets. In aggregate, these two datasets combined create the most complete measurement of OSS usage ( q ) to date. Further, by focusing on OSS that is widely deployed and used by firms, rather than considering all the projects that exist in an OSS repository, we enhance the methodologies of prior studies by reducing the likelihood of measurement error stemming from projects that are posted as publicly available OSS but are not actually used in any practical manner. Not accounting for this\n\nmeasurement error would lead to overestimation of the actual value of OSS as projects that are widely used would be valued in the same way as projects that are not used at all.\n\nTo estimate p ,  we  follow  the  literature  discussed  above  and  use  the  labor  replacement value. First, we calculate the labor cost it would take an individual firm to recreate a given OSS package by measuring the number of lines of code within the package and then applying the Constructive Cost Model II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) - also known as COCOMO II to estimate the number of person-hours it would take to write the code from scratch. We then utilize global wage data from Salary Expert to get an accurate estimate of the labor costs a firm would incur if this piece of OSS did not exist. These costs can be combined with the q values from above at the OSS package level to estimate the combined value of all OSS from both the supply and demand sides.\n\nWe find a value ranging from $1.22 billion to $6.22 billion if we were to decide as a society to recreate all widely used OSS on the supply side. However, considering the actual usage of OSS leads to a demand-side value that is orders of magnitude larger and ranges from $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion, if each firm who used an OSS package had to recreate it from scratch (e.g., the concept of OSS did not exist). We document substantial heterogeneity of the value of OSS by programming  language  and  internal  vs  outward-facing  programming  efforts.  Further,  we  find considerable  heterogeneity  in  value  contributions  by  programmers  as  5%  of  programmers  are responsible for more than 90% of the value created on the supply- and demand- side. The data we use is arguably the most comprehensive source of data to measure the value created by firm usage of OSS at this time. However, as for any project, the evidence is not complete and we argue that we underestimate the value since our data, e.g., does not include operating systems, which are a substantial omitted category of OSS.\n\nThis study makes four important contributions to the academic literature, practitioners, and policy makers. First, it provides the most complete estimate of the value of widely used OSS to date  by  accounting  for  not  only  the  supply-side  of  OSS  (price  to  create  it),  but  also  for  the usage\/demand-side at a scale that has not been done before. While prior estimates of the value of OSS only went either broad (estimating the supply-side costs of a large swath of OSS) or deep (estimating the value created by one particular type of OSS), this study does both by using unique datasets that allow for a better understanding of the breadth and depth of OSS usage. Further, rather than measuring the value of all OSS, this study focuses on the value of OSS that is used by firms\n\nto create its products and websites, limiting the measurement error occurring in studies that are unable to account for which OSS is actually used in production. This contribution builds upon, and extends, important research (e.g., Blind et al., 2021; Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021; Robbins et al., 2021) that has sought to identify the value of this vital resource that contributes a great deal to the modern economy despite the difficulties measuring this contribution. In  doing  so,  it  adds  insights  to  a  long-running  discussion  related  to  the  impact  of  information technology (IT) on productivity (Brynjolfsson, 1993; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 1996; Nagle, 2019a; Solow, 1987) known as the 'productivity paradox' where IT investments can have limited impact on productivity statistics. This debate has continued into the emerging context of AI (Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson, 2018). Our work contributes to this conversation by highlighting a massive societal level cost-savings (and hence productivity enhancement) that is created by the existence of OSS.\n\nSecond, our research contributes methodological advances to the study of intangible capital by highlighting novel sources of data related to investments in OSS. Prior research has shown that intangible capital plays an increasingly important role in economic growth (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel,  2009)  and  firm  value  (Peters  and  Taylor,  2017),  but  it  often  goes  unmeasured  or misattributed (Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou, 2014). Further, we demonstrate how these data sources can be used to understand the true investments in software that a firm makes, and that which they would have to make if OSS did not exist.  This  is  valuable  as  investments  in  software  are  an increasingly important type of intangible capital that is driving innovation (Branstetter, Drev, and Kwon, 2019) and performance (Krishnan et al., 2000).\n\nThird, our results help highlight for firms and managers the importance of OSS to their production, and ideally add weight to arguments that users of OSS should not just free ride but also contribute to the creation and maintenance of OSS (e.g., Henkel, 2008; Nagle, 2018). Such contributions are a fraction of the costs that firms would incur if OSS did not exist and the active participation of OSS users in helping maintain the OSS they use is critical to the health and future well-being of the OSS ecosystem (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021; Zhang et al., 2019).\n\nFourth,  and  finally,  our  study  helps  inform  policymakers  who  have  recently  started  to understand  the  growing  importance  of  OSS  to  the  economy  and  taken  actions  to  support  the ecosystem (European Commission, 2020; Executive Order No. 14028, 2021). However, most of these efforts are related to securing the existing OSS ecosystem, which is quite important, but do\n\nnot go as far as supporting the creation of new OSS. Our results help shine light on the importance of OSS to the overall economy and add weight to calls for more societal support of this critical resource. Our results further show that the majority of the value created by OSS is created by a small  number  of  contributors.  Although  it  has  long  been  known  that  a  small  number  of  OSS contributors do most of the work, we add new insights that show this is even more true for the value creation of widely-used OSS projects and that societal support for these individuals is critical to the future success of OSS, and in turn, the economy.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Methodology\n\nWe first measure the value of OSS by considering the supply and the demand side of OSS using a labor market approach. 14 The thought experiment is that we live in a world where OSS does not exist and has to be recreated at each firm that uses a given piece of OSS. Using the labor market approach, we calculate the labor replacement cost of each OSS package. To estimate the value for each package, we use COCOMO II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) at the individual package level and then sum across all package values to obtain a supply-side labor market replacement value. Then, we scale the supply-side value by the number of times firms are using each package while removing multi-usage within each firm to obtain a demand-side value.\n\nSecond, we move beyond the aggregate and inspect inequality in the value creation process. In OSS, as with many creative endeavors, it is common that a small handful of individuals provide the bulk of the contributions, while many others make small contributions (sometimes referred to as the 80\/20 rule, implying 80% of the work is done by 20% of the people). Research has shown these frequent contributors often attain positions of influence in OSS communities as a result of their efforts (Hanisch, et al, 2018). Therefore, to better understand the dispersion of value creation across developers, we first use the GHTorrent data and identify individual developer contributions in two ways: a) through their OSS value contributions directly and b) through the total number of repositories they contributed to. We then test how concentrated these two contribution measures are to better understand whether many or few developers contribute to the total value we measure. We explain the exact details for the labor market approach and the inequality of valuations below.\n\nDocument 9: ## 3.1 Labor market approach\n\nFor the labor market approach, we estimate the value of OSS by calculating the replacement value of a package. We ask how much it would cost to reproduce the package by hiring a programmer and paying them a competitive market wage. To estimate this supply-side value ( 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; ) , we take the complete list of OSS packages discussed above, and then count the lines of code in each unique\n\n14 In an alternative version, we use a mixture of a labor and goods market approach that is more closely aligned with Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff, et al (2021). However, applying this method in our setting requires numerous additional assumptions due to data constraints. For simplicity we call it the goods market approach for which we provide the details and statistics, as well as the limitations in Appendix A.\n\npackage. 15 For each unique package,  , we calculate the value and then sum over all these values i to obtain the total value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nIn this calculation, we implicitly do not incorporate any production externalities since we assume that there is no spillover knowledge from one package to the next that would lower the cost of programming. 16 This methodology is similar to that used by other papers that estimate the supply-side costs of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021).\n\nWe then calculate the demand-side value of OSS by incorporating the usage information ( Q) for each package:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nHere, we do not incorporate consumption externalities, i.e., we do not allow a benefit to arise for the general public when a package has been created and we further make sure that each firm is only replacing a package they use once, since a replaced package can be used within a firm as a club good (e.g., see Cornes and Sandler, 1996). The value 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost to rewrite all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the concept of OSS still exists, but all of these packages needed to be rewritten from scratch), while the value 𝑉 + \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost for each firm that uses one of these OSS packages to pay a developer to rewrite those packages (e.g., OSS itself no longer exists).\n\nFor both the supply and demand models, we obtain the dollar-value for each package ( 𝑃 ( ) via the Constructive Cost Model II, also abbreviated as COCOMO II (Boehm 1984, Boehm et al. 2009). The model has previously been used by the United States Department of Defense to estimate software project costs as well as in prior research estimating the value of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021). It is a highly flexible model that allows us to create non-linear transformations of lines of code to dollar-values. It uses the following modelling equation:\n\n15 We use only the pure lines of code excluding documentation lines and empty lines. Hence, we underestimate the true value of recreating each package.\n\n16 Similar to a representative agent model (e.g. see Williamson 2006), one may think of each package being reproduced by separate programmers who are identical replicas of each other (and therefore have the same skill level, but do not become more efficient via learning).\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n( (\n\nwhere 𝐿 represents the lines of codes in thousands and E the effort in person-month units for each project  . Consistent with Blind et al. (2021), we use the default parameter values for i 𝛼 , 𝛽 and 𝜂. The parameters 𝛼 𝛽 , are non-linear adjustment factors set to 2.94, and 1.0997 respectively . The parameter 𝜂 is an effort-adjustment factor which can be modified to incorporate subjective assessments of product, hardware, personnel, and project attributes. Since we do not have a prior for each project, we set 𝜂 to the default value of one. To obtain the price ( 𝑃 ( ) of each OSS project, we  then  multiply  the  results  of  equation  (3)  by  the  weighted  global  wage  that  an  average programmer would obtain on the open market. To calculate a global wage, we include the base monthly salaries of software developers from Salary Expert for the top 30 countries in terms of their GitHub developer counts in 2021 (Wachs et al., 2022). 17 The weight of each country is its share of active GitHub contributors over the total contributors in the top 30 countries. We further create bounds by using a low-wage (India) and high-wage (USA) labor market for the wage to better understand how the value would vary by the pool of programmers used to recreate all of OSS. 18\n\nDocument 11: ## 4. Results\n\nAfter applying the labor market approach using COCOMO II, we obtain global estimates for the value of OSS. To calculate the overall value, we first need the underlying number of lines of code (to calculate the supply-side value) and then the usage statistics (for the demand-side value). Since there may be substantial heterogeneity in value by programming languages, we also show the top programming languages during our investigation period in the year 2020, as discussed above.\n\nDocument 21: ## Appendix A) Goods-Market Valuation Approach\n\nAs an alternate estimation method, instead of using the labor replacement cost, we use a goods replacement value approach. We identify several OSS packages that have similar closed-source, pecuniary alternatives and consider the costs if all commercial users of the free OSS had to replace that software with a pecuniary alternative (similar to the calculations Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) performed for web servers). We can then use this alternate value of p , combined with the q values from above to estimate a goods replacement value of OSS. This method builds on suggestions from Nordhaus (2006, p. 146) who says '…the price of market and nonmarket goods and services should be imputed on the basis of the comparable market goods and services.' We do not expect the estimates from the two methods to be similar. Quite the contrary, the value of those two methods varies substantially since the latter goods-market approach assumes a fixed price to sell a good multiple times and that fixed price is usually lower than the total value estimated from recreating all packages on the labor side. The differential between these estimates is  essentially the result of a firm stepping in to reproduce the missing OSS packages and then selling them for a pecuniary price rather than all firms needing to reproduce those packages from scratch themselves.\n\nWith the goods market approach, the thought experiment is still that we live in a world where OSS does not exist, but it has to be recreated via one firm that then charges a price for a good that is currently free. To value OSS via the goods market approach, we created a basket of equivalent substitute proprietary goods that are priced on the open market as a stand-in for an OSS product.  This  methodology  is  consistent  with  that  used  in  the  prior  literature  (Greenstein  and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021) although both of those studies only used a single good rather than a basket since they were focused on only one type of OSS (web servers). Since there is no readily available database for proprietary equivalents of OSS, we conduct a search based on subjective  perception  of  popularity  of  OSS  and  we  then  search  for  pecuniary,  closed-source substitutes for them. The resulting basket of 20 OSS packages with proprietary substitutes is a good representation of the diversity of OSS. The software ranges from media and design software to statistical analysis programs, to database management and web server software. 21\n\n21 Table A5 shows the basket of OSS and their proprietary equivalents that we used. To create this basket, we looked for proprietary software that had an OSS equivalent that was similar in its overall function and feature set, and sought to identify pairs of software that, in aggregate, captured a broad and representative set of the types of OSS that exist.\n\nBased on our OSS equivalent substitute proprietary goods basket we then obtain prices for each proprietary software equivalent and we calculated the COCOMO labor market supply-side value for each OSS product in the basket which we use as a proxy - for lack of the code from the proprietary software - for the COCOMO labor supply side value of the proprietary software (e.g., the cost it would take to pay a programmer to write that proprietary software from scratch). We then calculate the average COCOMO labor supply-side value of the basket, 𝑉 !,1#23.4 ,  and  the average price for the basket, 𝑃 !,1#23.4 . 22 Since, we know the labor market supply-side value of all OSS, 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; , we can setup the following equation and obtain the price of OSS, 𝑃 ! for the goodsmarket for all OSS via a simple scaling transformation:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nThis results in the following goods-market supply-side value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nWe can then obtain the equivalent demand-side goods-market values as follows:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nFrom the goods market side, we consider the equivalent price that a firm would charge if it produced all existing widely used OSS and then sold it as a product to customers.\n\nTable A6, column 3 shows that the value on the demand side ranges between $177 million and $244 million across the different buckets independent of the country of origin from which programmers are hired. Naturally, the goods-market value will be substantially smaller than the labor demand value since this imaginary firm will make a profit at a comparatively low price by producing the software once and then selling it to many customers. Further, while Greenstein and Nagle (2014) as well as Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) focus on one particular type of software only (web servers), we attempt to expand on their approach to many goods. However, the data limitations become a stronger constraint in this context which makes it inherently more difficult\n\n22 We obtained the average price of the goods-market proprietary basket by using a 3 years lifespan of software, i.e. 1\/(1-0.66), so the depreciation factor is 0.33. This is consistent with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules for depreciating software, which states 'If you can depreciate the cost of computer software, use the straight line method over a useful life of 36 months.' https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/publications\/p946#en\\_US\\_2022\\_publink1000107354.\n\nto  estimate  the  value  through  this  approach  while  requiring  substantially  more  assumptions. Instead of a pure goods-market approach, this requires assistance from the labor-market approach in terms of scaling for the estimate, which ultimately leads to a substantial underestimate of the value of OSS. Further, the pricing strategy of the proprietary software counterparts is sensitive to the  market  demand.  With  the  goods-market  approach  extending  to  multiple  goods,  the  strong implicit assumption is that the market demands for our basket software and our sample OSS are similar, so they lead to commensurate prices.\n\nAn alternative and even more simplified goods-market back-of-the-envelope calculation that does not account for lines of code and relies on no scaling from the labor market approach would simply be to multiply a price of a reference good with the usage. We can take the minimum, average, and maximum prices of the basket of proprietary goods as captured in the reference price vector p = (69.99, 1610.17, 5800) and simply multiply it with usage from the combined Census and BuiltWith sample (Table 1). Based on those imputed proprietary price assumptions, the goods market demand side value would range from $0.2 - $16.5 trillion (minimum price - maximum price)  with  the  mean  price  resulting  in  a  value  estimate  of  $4.5  trillion.  However,  while  this estimate creates slightly more variance than the labor market approach, it is inherently flawed by simply assuming that the imputed prices are identical for each open source product based on the reference price. We further think this very simple back-of-the-envelope is an orange to apples comparison since the goods in our basket are fully functional, stand-alone software packages, while the packages in the Census and BuiltWith datasets are comprised of application libraries, which are generally smaller than such stand-alone packages.\n\nGiven all the complexities and assumptions one has to make due to lack of data for a goodsmarket approach, we place stronger emphasis on the labor cost approach highlighted in the main body but we include this method here for completeness.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"double","original_questions":[{"question":"How does the Harvard Business School's OSS report measure the value of open source software using a labor market approach?","answer":"The report measures the value of OSS by calculating the labor replacement cost of each OSS package.

Panel A shows the supply side value with the labor value being displayed on the vertical axis. We find that OSS packages created in Go have the highest value with $803 million in value that would have to be created from scratch if the OSS packages did not exist. Go is closely followed by JavaScript  and  Java  with  $758  million  and  $658  million,  respectively.  The  value  of  C  and Typescript is $406 million and $317 million, respectively, while Python has the lowest value of the top languages with around $55 million. JavaScript is not only the top language on GitHub since at least 2014 (GitHub, 2022) it is also the language with one of the highest values in our data. In contrast, Python became more popular over time moving up from the number four spot to the number two language being used in 2020 across all OSS packages on GitHub, while it is in the last spot of our top languages.\n\nPanel B shows the demand side value across the top programming languages. Based on usage generated value, Go is more than four times the value of the next language, JavaScript.\n\nTypescript (a language that extends JavaScript) has seen immense growth rising from the tenth spot of the top 10 languages in 2017 to the fourth spot in 2020 which is also reflected in our data with  Typescript  being  the  third  most  important  language  on  the  demand  side.  The  two  web languages are followed by C and far behind are Java, and Python.\n\nDocument 14: ## --- Figure 2 about here ---\n\nFigure 2 splits the OSS value estimates for each language by our inward facing (Census) and outward facing (BuiltWith) data sources. Panel A and Panel B focus on the supply and demand side estimation for the Census. We obtain a similar pattern that has been established already in the aggregate when pooling both data sources (Figure 1) albeit the impact of JavaScript is substantially lower.  On  the  supply  side  of  the  Census  in  Panel  A,  Java  has  the  second-highest  value  while JavaScript  code  from  the  Census  contributes  to  a  substantially  lower  value  to  the  aggregate. Similarly, the supply side values of C, Python, and Typescript are mainly driven by the Census. From the demand side Panel B we find that Go is the most popular language for inward facing code while all other languages appear to be negligible in relative terms.\n\nFigure 2, Panel C and Panel D show the supply and demand side values for the BuiltWith dataset. The supply side value in Panel C clearly indicates that the value from the BuiltWith sample is driven by JavaScript code, which is a good sanity check since we focused on JavaScript packages to proxy for OSS in the BuiltWith sample, as discussed above. The second highest value is created by TypeScript which is reassuring since it is a superset of JavaScript. Panel D shows a similar pattern  on  the  usage  side  where  most  of  the  value  arises  from  JavaScript  while  TypeScript  is trailing at the second spot as well. The other languages contribute only marginal amounts to the supply and demand side values. Overall, these findings are broadly consistent with the main use cases of the various languages (web programming vs. application programming) and an idea that languages through which value are generated are not necessarily identical to languages that are used by the general public.\n\n--- Figure 3 about here ---\n\nFigure 3 shows the demand-side value of OSS across industries by NAICS 2-digit codes using the BuiltWith online data. 20 This can be interpreted as the value each of these industries receive because OSS exists. The industry with the highest usage value of around $43 billion is 'Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.' 'Retail Trade' as well as 'Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services' make up another large part of the demand-side externally facing value of OSS with $36 billion and $35 billion, respectively. In contrast, industries that constitute just a small portion of the value are 'Mining, Quarrying, and Oil  and  Gas  Extraction',  'Utilities',  'Agriculture,  Forestry,  Fishing,  and  Hunting.'  The  latter industries are classical non-service sector industries and as such software is expected to play less of a role there.\n\nDocument 12: ## --- Table 1 about here ---\n\nTable  1  shows  descriptive  statistics  from  both  data  sets  separately.  The  inward-facing Census  (Panel  A)  contains  just  over  261.7  million  lines  of  code  with  72%  of  the  lines  being attributable to the top programming languages. The average package includes 142 thousand lines of code with a slightly lower average of 113 thousand lines of code for the subset of top languages. When considering the demand (usage) side, we observe that the Census packages were used over 2.7 million times while 92% of this usage is attributable to the top languages. The average package was used 1,472.4 times with a higher usage of around 1,497.5 for the top  languages.  For  the outward-facing  BuiltWith  data  we  find  similar  patterns,  but  at  different  levels.  The  packages included from BuiltWith include over 82 million lines of code, 71% of which are attributable to the  top  programming  languages.  The  average  package  within  the  BuiltWith  sample  has  111 thousand  lines  of  code  with  a  lower  average  of  around  80  thousand  lines  of  code  for  the  top languages. This is because our BuiltWith data primarily consists of JavaScript-based packages, which are often smaller than packages written in other languages. BuiltWith packages were used over 142 thousand times where 99.97% were attributable to the top languages. Next, we used these raw observations to calculate the value of all OSS through the labor market approach and estimated the value created from the supply and demand side.\n\n--- Table 2 about here ---\n\nTable 2 shows the estimates for the value of OSS based on the firm-relevant joint Census and BuiltWith sample. All estimates in Table 2 are based only on software languages classified in bucket  1  from  Table  A1,  which  are  the  most  likely  to  be  written  by  a  human  rather  than  a machine. 19 The first column contains estimates with wages from a low income country (India), the global  average  wage,  and  a  high  income  country  (United  States  of  America),  respectively  (as described above). To reproduce all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the idea of OSS still exists, but all current OSS is deleted and needs to be coded from scratch), using programmers at the average developer wage from India, it would require an investment of $1.22 billion. In contrast, if we use the average developer wage from the United States, then reproducing all widely-used OSS would require  an  investment  of  $6.22  billion.  Using  a  pool  of  programmers  from  across  the  world, weighed based on the existing geographic contributions to OSS as discussed above, would lead to an investment somewhere in between the low and high-income country, $4.15 billion. It is useful to compare these numbers to those from similar studies to understand differences in valuing all OSS (prior studies) versus that which is widely used (our study). Robbins et al. (2021) and Blind et al. (2021) use a method similar to ours and estimate that the value of OSS created in the US is $38 billion in 2019 and that created in the EU is €1 billion in 2018. Wachs et al. (2022) show that roughly 50% of OSS contributions come from the US and EU combined. In aggregate, that would lead these studies to give a global value of OSS of $78 billion. Thus, our middle estimate of a supply-side value of $4.15 billion for only firm-oriented and widely used OSS is a credible lowerbound and highlights the higher estimations of the total of supply-side value of OSS when not considering whether or not a given OSS package is widely used. This further indicates that the supply-side value of the most widely used OSS is roughly 5.5% of the supply-side value of all OSS.\n\nThe second column in Table 2 contains the demand side estimates based on the labor market approach. We find that if firms had to recreate all OSS packages they used (e.g., OSS itself no longer existed and every firm that used an OSS package had to recreate it), then the entire cost would amount to between $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion using labor from the low wage or high wage country only, respectively. A pool of programmers across the globe could recreate all of OSS that is being widely used for a cost of approximately $8.80 trillion. Interpreting this number is\n\n19 Tables in the appendix show the equivalent values from Table 2 when including software language buckets 1 and 2 (Table A3) and all three software language buckets (Table A4).\n\nslightly more complicated but still feasible. According to a Statista (2023) report, global software revenue in 2020 (the same year as our data) was $531.7 billion. However, this represents a flow, not a stock, of software. Relying on government estimates that software fully depreciates over three years, we can do a back of the envelope calculation and consider the purchase value of the full stock of prepackaged software used in 2020 as the aggregate of that sold from 2018 to 2020, which is $1.54 trillion. Further, this represents only the expenditure on prepackaged software and does  not  include  custom  purchased  or  in-house  developed  software.  Here,  the  best  obtainable estimates of private-sector investment in software overall come from the United States National Income and Product Accounts data (NIPA 2023). In 2020, the national account data shows that in the  US,  private  firms  spent  $479.2  billion  on  software,  of  which  45%  ($215.5  billion)  was prepackaged. If we assume this is a consistent ratio for the rest of the world, then the total amount firms spent on software being used in 2020 was $3.4 trillion (= $1.54 trillion\/0.45). Combining this rough estimate with the demand side estimate of the value of OSS based on an average global wage ($8.8 trillion), this indicates firms would spend $12.2 trillion (=$3.4 trillion + $8.8 trillion), or three and a half times what they currently spend if they needed to pay in-house developers to write the OSS that they currently use for free.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"double","original_questions":[{"question":"Which programming language has the highest value on the supply side according to Figure 1?","answer":"According to Figure 1, Go has the highest value on the supply side with $803 million."},{"question":"What is the estimated cost to recreate all widely-used OSS using programmers from the United States?","answer":"Recreating all widely-used OSS using programmers from the United States would require an investment of $6.22 billion."}],"seed_document_id":13,"topic":"Others"}}

Empirical Setting and Data\n\nAlthough the concept of free and open software has existed since the 1950's, it became more popular in the 1980's due to the efforts of Richard Stallman and his launch of the GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation (Maracke, 2019). However, it was in the 1990's that OSS took off after Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel, a now widely adopted OSS operating system (Tozzi, 2016). Today, OSS is considered a key building block of the digital economy and is widely used by software developers in everything from phones to cars to refrigerators to cutting-edge AI (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021).\n\nWe use two complementary main data sources to estimate the value of OSS. The first is the Census and is inward facing. It allows us to identify OSS code that goes into products that firms create. The second dataset is BuiltWith and is outward facing, allowing us to identify OSS code  that  consumers  directly  interact  with  through  firm  websites.  Since  the  raw  data  in  both datasets only contains package names, version numbers, and package manager names, and does not  contain  any  source  code  related  information,  we  first  obtain  the  publicly  accessible  code repository for each package which includes package-level information including the lines of code and  the  programming  languages  used.  One  may  worry  about  double-counting  for  the  value calculations as a result of using two separate datasets. However, the overlap of both the Census and  the  BuiltWith  sample  is  very  small:  there  are  only  18  packages  found  in  both  datasets. Moreover, it is unlikely that double counting is a concern as the two datasets capture different dimensions of OSS usage: the Census captures packaged software whose usage is inward-facing while BuiltWith captures usage in websites that are outward-facing. Finally, as a supplementary\n\ndataset, we use GHTorrent, a detailed history of OSS-related activity on GitHub, the most popular OSS hosting platform and a commonly used data source for studies of OSS (e.g., Burton et al, 2017; Conti, Peukert, and Roche, 2023; Fackler, Hofmann, and Laurentsyeva, 2023; Kim, 2020; Tang, Wang, &amp; Tong, 2023). This detailed historical data allows us to go deeper into how the value  of  OSS  is  created  by  better  understanding  the  dispersion  of  the  contributions  across individual OSS developers. We describe the details of all three data sources and their preparation for estimation below.\n\nCensus. The  Census  II  of  Free  and  Open  Source  Software  (here:  Census)  was  jointly undertaken by the Linux Foundation and the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (Nagle et  al.,  2022). 1 The  Census  was  created  via  the  aggregation  of  data  from  three  major  software composition analysis (SCA) firms with thousands of clients across the globe. SCAs are hired to scan the codebase of a client and gather the OSS usage embedded in their proprietary software to ensure they are not violating any OSS license agreements.  Frequently this takes place as part of 2 the due diligence process related to mergers and acquisitions. Unlike other OSS demand measures available from public sources such as package download counts and code changes, the way this data was collected ensures that we observe the precise amount and type of internal OSS usage of the firms. In addition, it allows us to trace the dependencies each package relies on, so that we can observe the indirect OSS usage that is commonly hidden and difficult to obtain.  The result is over 3 2.7 million observations of OSS packages being used within products created by the SCA client firms for the calendar year 2020 (January 1 to December 31, 2020). 4\n\nThe Census project standardized package names based on the naming system of libraries.io -  a  widely  used  site  maintained  by  Tidelift  that  organizes  information  about  more  than  eight million open source packages. The Census focused on the top 2,000 packages based on usage\n\n1 The precise methodologies for the data collection and aggregation are detailed in the Census report by Nagle et al (2022).\n\n2 OSS usage licenses vary a great deal and while some licenses are very open and allow the code to be reused in any manner, including within proprietary code that will be made available for sale at a non-zero price, other licenses restrict reuse to only be allowed if the resultant code is released under the same OSS license (known as copyleft). A detailed discussion of OSS licenses can be found in Lerner and Tirole (2005) and Almeida et al (2017).\n\n3 Indirect OSS usage is captured by dependency analysis and is necessary to accurately measure the full breadth of the OSS a firm relies on. For example, if a firm's proprietary code calls OSS package A, but package A, in turn, calls package B, then only looking at the direct calls would miss that package B was a required building block for the firm's proprietary code.\n\n4 The Census defines an OSS package as 'a unit of software that can be installed and managed by a package manager,' and  defines  a  package  manager  as  'software  that  automates  the  process  of  installing  and  otherwise  managing packages' (Nagle et al, 2022).\n\nreported from the three of the most prominent SCA vendors to identify the most widely used OSS rather  than  the  long-tail  of  the  usage  distribution.  This  led  to  packages  with  less  than  five observations  of  usage  being  dropped.  Since  packages  written  in  the  JavaScript  programming language, and usually hosted on the Node Package Manager (NPM), are generally smaller (fewer lines  of  code)  than  packages  in  other  languages  and  therefore  frequently  have  higher  usage numbers (since developers must include many small packages instead of a few large packages), the Census separately selected the top 1,000 NPM packages and the top 1,000 non-NPM hosted packages.\n\nThis final dataset covers 70% of the total usage of OSS observed in the raw data of the census.   For  each  of  these  2,000  OSS  packages  in  the  Census,  we  identified  the  raw  code 5 maintained on GitHub, the most widely used platform for hosting OSS.  We first attempted to 6 obtain the GitHub repository uniform resource locator (URL) for each package from libraries.io. We were able to match 1,657 packages to repositories via this initial method.  For URLs without 7 a  matching  repository,  we  performed  Google  searches  loosely  following  the  method  in  Singh (2020). More specifically, for each unmatched package, we used the Google API to search for the package name and 'GitHub Repository' and treated the first GitHub repository URL in the results as  its  best  matched  GitHub  URL.   This  resulted  in  an  additional  174  packages  matched  to  a 8 repository. Finally, we manually searched for URLs for the remaining 169 packages to identify the relevant repository. This entire process resulted in matching 1,840 out of the 2,000 Census packages to a code repository with the raw source code for the package. The unmatched packages were determined to have been either removed from GitHub or became proprietary (and thus the original source code was no longer available) and hence, the manual search allowed us to drop\n\n5 The packages that made up the remaining 30% of the full Census data in the long-tail usage distribution were not shared in the final report and therefore cannot be included in our analysis.\n\n6 GitHub  is  a  hosting  and  collaboration  platform  that  contributors  can  use  to  coordinate  the  development  and distribution of OSS projects. Founded in 2008, GitHub has become the largest hub for OSS development in the world. In January 2023, GitHub had more than 370 million repositories and over 100 million developers. In addition to personal users, a wide range of private firms actively use the GitHub platform, including Microsoft (which bought GitHub in 2018), Facebook, Google, and numerous other small and large firms.\n\n7 We attempted to access all repository URLs obtained as a sanity check to ensure they are in working condition. For those we could not access on GitHub, we manually found the correct URLs.\n\n8 As a robustness check, we randomly selected 50 package-repository matches derived from the Google Search method and we checked them by hand. All matches were manually confirmed to be correct providing additional support for the automated matching method.\n\nthese 160 unmatched packages (less than 8% of the Census sample of 2,000) with high confidence from our analysis.\n\nBuiltWith. The BuiltWith data contains scans of all public websites across the globe and identifies the technologies they use. Unlike the inward facing Census data which focus on the usage of OSS, the BuiltWith data scan for the use of both proprietary and OSS in firm websites without explicit differentiation. To separate OSS from proprietary software in BuiltWith, we turn to the subset of all open source web development software in the technology category that includes \"JavaScript and its libraries,\" which generates 778 observations corresponding to the NPM OSS category  in  the  Census  data.  There  are  two  reasons  for  this  sampling  choice.  First,  this  given category is constructed by BuiltWith and we use it as a proxy for OSS to separate it from pecuniary software.  Second,  JavaScript,  one  of  the  core  technologies  for  building  websites,  is  the  most popular programming language by usage on GitHub (GitHub, 2022) and thus enables us to capture the most important OSS from the demand side perspective. The scans include 8.8 million unique websites and 72.8 million corresponding observations of OSS usage from January 1 to November 16, 2020. Further, to ensure that we measure the value of OSS usage generated by the private sector,  we  match  the  adopting  domains  of  the  JavaScript-related  OSS  from  BuiltWith  with company websites recorded in Orbis, Compustat, and PitchBook, three commonly used databases of corporate activity that capture registered businesses across the world. Performing this match ensures that OSS used by non-commercial websites (e.g., an individual person's personal website) is excluded in our analysis. This results in a match-rate of 38.6%, which corresponds to around 3.4 million websites of distinct firms.\n\nFor the BuiltWith data, we cannot employ the first method we use for the Census (using libraries.io to help identify the repository URL) since only the technology names associated with the  packages  were  provided  by  BuiltWith,  and  other  information  (e.g.,  package  and  package manager  names)  is  not  included. 9 Hence,  we  start  by  performing  the  Google  Search  method mentioned above which results in a match of 695 packages to repositories. We then manually searched the Github URLs for 83 of the remaining unmatched packages, resulting in an addition of 46 packages. In total, for the BuiltWith data we were able to identify 741 out of 778 package-\n\n9 Since the package and package manager names are missing, a precise match using libraries.io was not feasible. Technology names are product names intended for customers and can be less technical and precise than the package names for internal development purposes. Thus, using technology names in a libraries.io search could cause significant ambiguity.\n\nrepository matches. As with the Census data, the remaining 37 unmatched packages (less than 5%) are dropped from our analysis because they had been deleted from GitHub.\n\nGHTorrent database. To obtain measures of the dispersion of the OSS value creation, we utilize  the  GHTorrent  database,  which  contains  the  entire  activity  history  on  GitHub  using GitHub's Representational State Transfer (REST) application programming interface (API). We leveraged  its  records  of  GitHub  repositories,  developer-level  commits,  and  developer  public profile information to estimate the contribution of each developer. We narrowed the sample for our developer contribution analysis in two steps. First, we winnowed the GitHub repositories and their  commits  from  GHTorrent  based  on  the  repository  URLs  of  our  joint  Census-BuiltWith sample. 10 Second, we focus on human contributions to OSS by removing approximately eight thousand (12%) GitHub contributors that we considered to be robots. 11 The final sample contains around sixty thousand developers and 2.3 million commits.\n\nTo prepare these three datasets for estimation, we first identified the number of lines of code and the programming languages used for each package using the OSS packages pygount (to count  the  number  of  lines  of  code)  and  linguist  (to  identify  programming  languages). 12 We categorize each distinct language into one of three different buckets moving from more likely human-written to more likely machine-written (see Table A1). Bucket 1 contains programming and markup languages (which are most likely to be human-written), bucket 3 contains data (most likely to be machine-written), and bucket 2 contains anything in between, such as config files and batch processing (which are sometimes human-written and sometimes machine-written, but it is difficult to tell based purely on looking at the code). 13 For our primary estimation we only use bucket 1 while providing robustness checks for buckets 2 and 3 in the Appendix, and thus our results represent a lower bound. Finally, for some analyses we dig deeper and show the top 5 programming languages (as classified by GitHub, 2022 for the year 2020; the year our data is from). The top 5 programming languages contain C (including C# and C++), Java, JavaScript,\n\n10 The match rate is over 96%, with the unmatched repositories accounting for only 0.15% of our calculated OSS demand value discussed below.\n\n11 The filtering is based on the 'fake user' classification by GHTorrent, as well as any usernames containing words 'bot' or 'robot', surrounded by special characters. This method is more conservative than other methods of bot detection  like  that  used  in  the  GitHub  Innovation  Graph  (https:\/\/innovationgraph.github.com\/),  which  rely  on  a monthly commit frequency threshold.\n\n12 https:\/\/pypi.org\/project\/pygount\/ and https:\/\/github.com\/github-linguist\/linguist\n\n13 Note that our focus is the cost to recreate OSS code written by humans, not robots. However, directly removing all OSS contributions from robot accounts is infeasible here, because we cannot observe the exact lines of code written by the robot accounts on GitHub.\n\nPython, and Typescript. We also add Go to this list of top languages since it is an increasingly widely used language in OSS.\n\nDocument 16: ## 5. Conclusion\n\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith. We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average value and distributed it across industries.\n\nIn this study we estimate the value of widely-used open source software globally with two unique datasets: the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data. We are able to estimate not only the supply side value of existing code (e.g., the cost it would take to rewrite each piece of widely-used OSS once) but also the demand side value for the private economy (e.g., the cost it would take for each company that uses a piece of OSS to rewrite it). While we do not focus on the long tail of OSS, we consider this an additional contribution of our study as focusing on OSS that is widely used allows us to more precisely understand the value created by OSS, rather than only measuring the  replacement  cost  for  all  OSS  (which  would  overestimate  the  true  value  since  many  OSS projects are not used in production code). However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n\nAdjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.  We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves.  Over  95%  percent  of  the  demand-side  value  is  generated  by  only  five  percent  of programmers, and those programmers contribute not only to a few widely used projects but to substantially more projects than the programmers that are engaged at the lower end of the value distribution.\n\nIn aggregate, our results show the substantial value that OSS contributes to the economy despite this value generally showing up as zero via direct measurement since prices equal zero and quantity is difficult to measure using public data alone. Our research lays the groundwork for future studies of not only OSS, but of all IT and its growing impact on the global economy.\n\nDocument 6: ## 1. Introduction\n\nIn 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that 'software is eating the world' (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that 'open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,' (Jacks, 2022). Other recent studies have come to similar conclusions showing that open source software  (OSS)  -  software  whose  source  code  is  publicly  available  for  inspection,  use,  and modification and is often created in a decentralized manner and distributed for free - appears in 96% of codebases (Synopsys 2023), and that some commercial software consists of up to 99.9% freely available OSS (Musseau et al., 2022). Although in its early days OSS frequently copied features from existing proprietary software, OSS today includes cutting edge technology in various fields including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, big data, and analytics.  However, despite the increasing importance of OSS to all software (and therefore to the entire economy), measuring its impact has been elusive. Traditionally, to measure the value created by a good or service,  economists  multiply  the  price  ( p )  times  the  quantity  sold  ( q ).  However,  in  OSS, p is generally zero since the source code is publicly available, and q is  unknown due to the limited number of restrictions around how the code may be copied and reused. For example, if a company downloads  a  piece  of  OSS  from  a  public  code  repository,  it  may  copy  it  thousands  of  times internally (legally) and then share it with suppliers or customers (also legally), so public download data is insufficient. Although some recent studies have sought to estimate the value of p (discussed below), data for estimating q has been unavailable or intractable for anything more than just a handful of OSS packages. Using newly collected data from multiple sources, the goal of this paper is to provide estimates for both p and q and to use those to shine light on the question: What is the value of open source software?\n\nUnderstanding the value of OSS is of critical importance not only due to the role it plays in the economy, but also due to it being one of the most successful and impactful modern examples of the centuries old economic concept of 'the commons' which run the risk of meeting the fate known as 'the tragedy of the commons.' This concept can trace its roots as far back as the 4 th -century BC philosopher Aristotle who wrote 'That which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care. Men pay most attention to what is their own and care less for what is common.'  (Aristotle,  1981).  William  Forster  Lloyd  (1833)  resurfaced  the  idea  in  modern economic thought by highlighting the example of shared tracts of land used for cattle grazing by\n\nmultiple cattle herders who each had an incentive to overuse the shared resource. Garrett Hardin (1968)  brought  the  concept  into  the  broader  zeitgeist  when  he  wrote  an  article  discussing  the problem entitled 'The Tragedy of the Commons.' Building on this work, Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for her research highlighting paths to avoiding the tragedy of the commons through community coordination efforts that did not necessitate government enforced laws to manage and guard the commons (Ostrom 1990). The parallels between shared grazing lands and shared digital infrastructure are palpable - the availability of communal grass to feed cattle, and in turn feed people, was critical to the agrarian economy, and the ability to not have to recreate code that someone else has already written is critical to the modern economy. Further, in both contexts, despite knowing grass and code are critical inputs to the economy, measuring their actual value is difficult. And, as the renowned mathematician and physicist Lord Kelvin is believed to have said, 'If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.' And if you cannot improve and maintain it, such common goods may crumble under the weight of their own success as they are overused, but underinvested in (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021). Therefore, measuring the value OSS creates is crucial to the future health of the digital economy, and the rest of the economy that is built on top of it.\n\nImportantly, recent studies have attempted to address these measurement issues but fall short of capturing both the breadth and depth of OSS usage - a gap we seek to fill with this paper. For example, researchers have attempted to gain breadth by using novel methodologies to estimate the labor replacement value of the current corpus of OSS created in the United States at $38 billion in 2019 (Robbins et al., 2021) and that created in the European Union at €1 billion (Blind et al., 2021) by imputing the labor costs that it would have taken to rewrite existing OSS. Such efforts do a very good job at estimating what it would cost to replace all existing OSS if it disappeared tomorrow. However, the resultant estimates rely on two important assumptions. First, that all OSS is equally valuable from a usage standpoint, and second that the concept of OSS would still exist, and society would just need to rewrite the code once, thus addressing the aforementioned problem of a missing value for p , but not addressing the missing value of q . In a world where OSS did not exist at all, then each piece of OSS software would not need to be rewritten just once, but instead would need to be rewritten by every firm that used the software (assuming the firm could freely share the software within its boundaries). Other research (Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; MurcianoGoroff, Zhuo, and Greenstein, 2021) has gone deeper into this hypothetical, albeit in a narrow\n\nmanner, by only focusing on web servers (which are public facing on the Internet and can therefore be readily measured). Using different methods, both studies measure q for this one type of software and impute p by using a goods replacement value approach based on the prices for closed-source alternatives offered by firms. With data from the United States the resulting estimates show a value of  $2  billion  for  the  OSS  Apache  Web  Server  in  2012  (Greenstein  and  Nagle,  2014)  and  a combined value of $4.5 billion for Apache and the increasingly popular OSS web server nginx in 2018 (Murciano-Goroff, et al., 2021). However, although web servers are an important part of the OSS  ecosystem,  they  constitute  a  small  portion  of  it.  We  seek  to  build  upon  the  important contributions this existing research has made in an attempt to go both broad and deep to create a more complete measure of the value of OSS.\n\nTo consider the value of OSS in both a broad and deep manner, we use data from two primary sources that allow us to gain insights into the OSS used at tens of thousands of firms across the world. The first is the 'Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries' (Nagle et al., 2022). The Census II project utilized partnerships with multiple software composition analysis (SCA) firms to create various lists of the most widely used OSS. SCAs are hired to scan the codebases of a company to ensure they are not violating any OSS licenses and, as a byproduct, track all the OSS code used by their customers and the products they build. The Census II project aggregated data from multiple SCAs to build a dataset of OSS usage at tens of thousands of firms based  on  millions  of  data  points  (observations  of  OSS  usage).  The  second  data  source  is  the BuiltWith dataset, from which we leverage scans of nearly nine million websites to identify the underlying technology deployed by these websites, including OSS libraries. The BuiltWith data has been used in multiple academic studies (DeStefano &amp; Timmis 2023, Dushnitsky &amp; Stroube 2021, Koning et al.. 2022), but to our knowledge this is the first one to focus on OSS usage. The Census II data and the BuiltWith data are complementary as the former focuses on OSS that is built  into  the  software  a  company  sells,  while  the  latter  focuses  on  OSS  that  is  built  into  a company's website, thus reducing the chances of double-counting observations across the datasets. In aggregate, these two datasets combined create the most complete measurement of OSS usage ( q ) to date. Further, by focusing on OSS that is widely deployed and used by firms, rather than considering all the projects that exist in an OSS repository, we enhance the methodologies of prior studies by reducing the likelihood of measurement error stemming from projects that are posted as publicly available OSS but are not actually used in any practical manner. Not accounting for this\n\nmeasurement error would lead to overestimation of the actual value of OSS as projects that are widely used would be valued in the same way as projects that are not used at all.\n\nTo estimate p ,  we  follow  the  literature  discussed  above  and  use  the  labor  replacement value. First, we calculate the labor cost it would take an individual firm to recreate a given OSS package by measuring the number of lines of code within the package and then applying the Constructive Cost Model II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) - also known as COCOMO II to estimate the number of person-hours it would take to write the code from scratch. We then utilize global wage data from Salary Expert to get an accurate estimate of the labor costs a firm would incur if this piece of OSS did not exist. These costs can be combined with the q values from above at the OSS package level to estimate the combined value of all OSS from both the supply and demand sides.\n\nWe find a value ranging from $1.22 billion to $6.22 billion if we were to decide as a society to recreate all widely used OSS on the supply side. However, considering the actual usage of OSS leads to a demand-side value that is orders of magnitude larger and ranges from $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion, if each firm who used an OSS package had to recreate it from scratch (e.g., the concept of OSS did not exist). We document substantial heterogeneity of the value of OSS by programming  language  and  internal  vs  outward-facing  programming  efforts.  Further,  we  find considerable  heterogeneity  in  value  contributions  by  programmers  as  5%  of  programmers  are responsible for more than 90% of the value created on the supply- and demand- side. The data we use is arguably the most comprehensive source of data to measure the value created by firm usage of OSS at this time. However, as for any project, the evidence is not complete and we argue that we underestimate the value since our data, e.g., does not include operating systems, which are a substantial omitted category of OSS.\n\nThis study makes four important contributions to the academic literature, practitioners, and policy makers. First, it provides the most complete estimate of the value of widely used OSS to date  by  accounting  for  not  only  the  supply-side  of  OSS  (price  to  create  it),  but  also  for  the usage\/demand-side at a scale that has not been done before. While prior estimates of the value of OSS only went either broad (estimating the supply-side costs of a large swath of OSS) or deep (estimating the value created by one particular type of OSS), this study does both by using unique datasets that allow for a better understanding of the breadth and depth of OSS usage. Further, rather than measuring the value of all OSS, this study focuses on the value of OSS that is used by firms\n\nto create its products and websites, limiting the measurement error occurring in studies that are unable to account for which OSS is actually used in production. This contribution builds upon, and extends, important research (e.g., Blind et al., 2021; Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021; Robbins et al., 2021) that has sought to identify the value of this vital resource that contributes a great deal to the modern economy despite the difficulties measuring this contribution. In  doing  so,  it  adds  insights  to  a  long-running  discussion  related  to  the  impact  of  information technology (IT) on productivity (Brynjolfsson, 1993; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 1996; Nagle, 2019a; Solow, 1987) known as the 'productivity paradox' where IT investments can have limited impact on productivity statistics. This debate has continued into the emerging context of AI (Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson, 2018). Our work contributes to this conversation by highlighting a massive societal level cost-savings (and hence productivity enhancement) that is created by the existence of OSS.\n\nSecond, our research contributes methodological advances to the study of intangible capital by highlighting novel sources of data related to investments in OSS. Prior research has shown that intangible capital plays an increasingly important role in economic growth (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel,  2009)  and  firm  value  (Peters  and  Taylor,  2017),  but  it  often  goes  unmeasured  or misattributed (Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou, 2014). Further, we demonstrate how these data sources can be used to understand the true investments in software that a firm makes, and that which they would have to make if OSS did not exist.  This  is  valuable  as  investments  in  software  are  an increasingly important type of intangible capital that is driving innovation (Branstetter, Drev, and Kwon, 2019) and performance (Krishnan et al., 2000).\n\nThird, our results help highlight for firms and managers the importance of OSS to their production, and ideally add weight to arguments that users of OSS should not just free ride but also contribute to the creation and maintenance of OSS (e.g., Henkel, 2008; Nagle, 2018). Such contributions are a fraction of the costs that firms would incur if OSS did not exist and the active participation of OSS users in helping maintain the OSS they use is critical to the health and future well-being of the OSS ecosystem (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021; Zhang et al., 2019).\n\nFourth,  and  finally,  our  study  helps  inform  policymakers  who  have  recently  started  to understand  the  growing  importance  of  OSS  to  the  economy  and  taken  actions  to  support  the ecosystem (European Commission, 2020; Executive Order No. 14028, 2021). However, most of these efforts are related to securing the existing OSS ecosystem, which is quite important, but do\n\nnot go as far as supporting the creation of new OSS. Our results help shine light on the importance of OSS to the overall economy and add weight to calls for more societal support of this critical resource. Our results further show that the majority of the value created by OSS is created by a small  number  of  contributors.  Although  it  has  long  been  known  that  a  small  number  of  OSS contributors do most of the work, we add new insights that show this is even more true for the value creation of widely-used OSS projects and that societal support for these individuals is critical to the future success of OSS, and in turn, the economy.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

In the first step, we measure the value contributions by developers. In a second step, we obtain a measure for the number of repositories developers contribute to. Finally, we provide a graphical representation of both using the commonly known concept of the Lorenz curve to better understand the extent of inequality in contributions. We describe the details below.\n\nValue Contribution. We calculated the supply and demand values of OSS that each developer contributed. At the repository level, we quantified each developer's proportional work contribution by calculating their share of commits to the total number of commits for a repository. This share was subsequently multiplied with the repository's demand and supply values separately to derive\n\n17 There are 179 counties in Wachs et al. (2022), but the top 30 countries consist of over 88% of the global active contributors with each of the rest having less than 0.6% share. The top 30 countries are listed in Table A2.\n\n18 We choose the high- and low-wage reference countries based on a combination of the number of active GitHub developers and the average annual software developer base wage.\n\nthe value-added contribution of that individual contributor to the repository. Finally, we aggregate the value contributions across all repositories for each developer. The individual value contribution from a unique developer Dev , 𝑉 -+.\/ , can be expressed as:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere 𝜎 ( +.\/ is the share of commits the focal developer made in repository  , and i 𝑉 (-is the demand or supply value of the entire repository   specified in Equations (1) and (2), with i 𝑗 ∈ {𝐷, 𝑆} , and N is the number of repositories in our main sample, i.e. Census and BuiltWith combined.\n\nRepository  Contribution. This  is  simply  the  number  of  repositories  a  given  developer contributes to, and it is expressed as follows:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere   is the indicator function equal to 1 when the developer has a non-zero number of commits 𝟙 to  repository i .  This  measure  entails  the  variety  of  OSS  needs  being  addressed  by  individual developers. Jointly with the value contribution measure, they help us understand whether the value that is being generated overall is concentrated within a small number of developers. It may be generally more desirable for the whole OSS ecosystem and its diversity if individual developers participate in many repositories and not just a few.\n\nMeasuring  the  Dispersion  of  Contributions . To  graphically  examine  the  dispersion  of developer contribution values, we utilized Lorenz curves (Lorenz, 1905), with respect to both demand and supply side values. Lorenz curves are a well-established way to represent inequality and, as such, they allow us to better understand how dispersed developer contributions to OSS within the private economy are. Developers are systematically arranged in ascending order based on their contributions to OSS demand and supply, as delineated in Equation (7). Subsequently, these ranks were normalized to a scale ranging from 0 to 100 percentiles, serving as the x-axis values for the Lorenz Curves. The y-axis, on the other hand, presents the corresponding value contributions 𝑉 -+.\/ . The graphical representation in the results section will elucidate the degree of inequality pertaining to the value contributions among developers. To supplement the analysis, we\n\nfurther investigated how dispersed the repository contribution, 𝑁 +.\/ , is by plotting Equation (8).

The industry with the highest demand-side value of open source software is 'Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services,' with an estimated value of around $43 billion.","reference_context":"Document 14: ## --- Figure 2 about here ---\n\nFigure 2 splits the OSS value estimates for each language by our inward facing (Census) and outward facing (BuiltWith) data sources. Panel A and Panel B focus on the supply and demand side estimation for the Census. We obtain a similar pattern that has been established already in the aggregate when pooling both data sources (Figure 1) albeit the impact of JavaScript is substantially lower.  On  the  supply  side  of  the  Census  in  Panel  A,  Java  has  the  second-highest  value  while JavaScript  code  from  the  Census  contributes  to  a  substantially  lower  value  to  the  aggregate. Similarly, the supply side values of C, Python, and Typescript are mainly driven by the Census. From the demand side Panel B we find that Go is the most popular language for inward facing code while all other languages appear to be negligible in relative terms.\n\nFigure 2, Panel C and Panel D show the supply and demand side values for the BuiltWith dataset. The supply side value in Panel C clearly indicates that the value from the BuiltWith sample is driven by JavaScript code, which is a good sanity check since we focused on JavaScript packages to proxy for OSS in the BuiltWith sample, as discussed above. The second highest value is created by TypeScript which is reassuring since it is a superset of JavaScript. Panel D shows a similar pattern  on  the  usage  side  where  most  of  the  value  arises  from  JavaScript  while  TypeScript  is trailing at the second spot as well. The other languages contribute only marginal amounts to the supply and demand side values. Overall, these findings are broadly consistent with the main use cases of the various languages (web programming vs. application programming) and an idea that languages through which value are generated are not necessarily identical to languages that are used by the general public.\n\n--- Figure 3 about here ---\n\nFigure 3 shows the demand-side value of OSS across industries by NAICS 2-digit codes using the BuiltWith online data. 20 This can be interpreted as the value each of these industries receive because OSS exists. The industry with the highest usage value of around $43 billion is 'Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.' 'Retail Trade' as well as 'Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services' make up another large part of the demand-side externally facing value of OSS with $36 billion and $35 billion, respectively. In contrast, industries that constitute just a small portion of the value are 'Mining, Quarrying, and Oil  and  Gas  Extraction',  'Utilities',  'Agriculture,  Forestry,  Fishing,  and  Hunting.'  The  latter industries are classical non-service sector industries and as such software is expected to play less of a role there.\n\nDocument 13: ## --- Figure 1 about here ---\n\nFigure 1 shows the heterogeneity of the value of OSS across the top programming languages. Panel A shows the supply side value with the labor value being displayed on the vertical axis. We find that OSS packages created in Go have the highest value with $803 million in value that would have to be created from scratch if the OSS packages did not exist. Go is closely followed by JavaScript  and  Java  with  $758  million  and  $658  million,  respectively.  The  value  of  C  and Typescript is $406 million and $317 million, respectively, while Python has the lowest value of the top languages with around $55 million. JavaScript is not only the top language on GitHub since at least 2014 (GitHub, 2022) it is also the language with one of the highest values in our data. In contrast, Python became more popular over time moving up from the number four spot to the number two language being used in 2020 across all OSS packages on GitHub, while it is in the last spot of our top languages.\n\nPanel B shows the demand side value across the top programming languages. Based on usage generated value, Go is more than four times the value of the next language, JavaScript.\n\nTypescript (a language that extends JavaScript) has seen immense growth rising from the tenth spot of the top 10 languages in 2017 to the fourth spot in 2020 which is also reflected in our data with  Typescript  being  the  third  most  important  language  on  the  demand  side.  The  two  web languages are followed by C and far behind are Java, and Python.\n\nDocument 16: ## 5. Conclusion\n\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith. We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average value and distributed it across industries.\n\nIn this study we estimate the value of widely-used open source software globally with two unique datasets: the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data. We are able to estimate not only the supply side value of existing code (e.g., the cost it would take to rewrite each piece of widely-used OSS once) but also the demand side value for the private economy (e.g., the cost it would take for each company that uses a piece of OSS to rewrite it). While we do not focus on the long tail of OSS, we consider this an additional contribution of our study as focusing on OSS that is widely used allows us to more precisely understand the value created by OSS, rather than only measuring the  replacement  cost  for  all  OSS  (which  would  overestimate  the  true  value  since  many  OSS projects are not used in production code). However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n\nAdjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.  We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves.  Over  95%  percent  of  the  demand-side  value  is  generated  by  only  five  percent  of programmers, and those programmers contribute not only to a few widely used projects but to substantially more projects than the programmers that are engaged at the lower end of the value distribution.\n\nIn aggregate, our results show the substantial value that OSS contributes to the economy despite this value generally showing up as zero via direct measurement since prices equal zero and quantity is difficult to measure using public data alone. Our research lays the groundwork for future studies of not only OSS, but of all IT and its growing impact on the global economy.\n\nDocument 12: ## --- Table 1 about here ---\n\nTable  1  shows  descriptive  statistics  from  both  data  sets  separately.  The  inward-facing Census  (Panel  A)  contains  just  over  261.7  million  lines  of  code  with  72%  of  the  lines  being attributable to the top programming languages. The average package includes 142 thousand lines of code with a slightly lower average of 113 thousand lines of code for the subset of top languages. When considering the demand (usage) side, we observe that the Census packages were used over 2.7 million times while 92% of this usage is attributable to the top languages. The average package was used 1,472.4 times with a higher usage of around 1,497.5 for the top  languages.  For  the outward-facing  BuiltWith  data  we  find  similar  patterns,  but  at  different  levels.  The  packages included from BuiltWith include over 82 million lines of code, 71% of which are attributable to the  top  programming  languages.  The  average  package  within  the  BuiltWith  sample  has  111 thousand  lines  of  code  with  a  lower  average  of  around  80  thousand  lines  of  code  for  the  top languages. This is because our BuiltWith data primarily consists of JavaScript-based packages, which are often smaller than packages written in other languages. BuiltWith packages were used over 142 thousand times where 99.97% were attributable to the top languages. Next, we used these raw observations to calculate the value of all OSS through the labor market approach and estimated the value created from the supply and demand side.\n\n--- Table 2 about here ---\n\nTable 2 shows the estimates for the value of OSS based on the firm-relevant joint Census and BuiltWith sample. All estimates in Table 2 are based only on software languages classified in bucket  1  from  Table  A1,  which  are  the  most  likely  to  be  written  by  a  human  rather  than  a machine. 19 The first column contains estimates with wages from a low income country (India), the global  average  wage,  and  a  high  income  country  (United  States  of  America),  respectively  (as described above). To reproduce all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the idea of OSS still exists, but all current OSS is deleted and needs to be coded from scratch), using programmers at the average developer wage from India, it would require an investment of $1.22 billion. In contrast, if we use the average developer wage from the United States, then reproducing all widely-used OSS would require  an  investment  of  $6.22  billion.  Using  a  pool  of  programmers  from  across  the  world, weighed based on the existing geographic contributions to OSS as discussed above, would lead to an investment somewhere in between the low and high-income country, $4.15 billion. It is useful to compare these numbers to those from similar studies to understand differences in valuing all OSS (prior studies) versus that which is widely used (our study). Robbins et al. (2021) and Blind et al. (2021) use a method similar to ours and estimate that the value of OSS created in the US is $38 billion in 2019 and that created in the EU is €1 billion in 2018. Wachs et al. (2022) show that roughly 50% of OSS contributions come from the US and EU combined. In aggregate, that would lead these studies to give a global value of OSS of $78 billion. Thus, our middle estimate of a supply-side value of $4.15 billion for only firm-oriented and widely used OSS is a credible lowerbound and highlights the higher estimations of the total of supply-side value of OSS when not considering whether or not a given OSS package is widely used. This further indicates that the supply-side value of the most widely used OSS is roughly 5.5% of the supply-side value of all OSS.\n\nThe second column in Table 2 contains the demand side estimates based on the labor market approach. We find that if firms had to recreate all OSS packages they used (e.g., OSS itself no longer existed and every firm that used an OSS package had to recreate it), then the entire cost would amount to between $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion using labor from the low wage or high wage country only, respectively. A pool of programmers across the globe could recreate all of OSS that is being widely used for a cost of approximately $8.80 trillion. Interpreting this number is\n\n19 Tables in the appendix show the equivalent values from Table 2 when including software language buckets 1 and 2 (Table A3) and all three software language buckets (Table A4).\n\nslightly more complicated but still feasible. According to a Statista (2023) report, global software revenue in 2020 (the same year as our data) was $531.7 billion. However, this represents a flow, not a stock, of software. Relying on government estimates that software fully depreciates over three years, we can do a back of the envelope calculation and consider the purchase value of the full stock of prepackaged software used in 2020 as the aggregate of that sold from 2018 to 2020, which is $1.54 trillion. Further, this represents only the expenditure on prepackaged software and does  not  include  custom  purchased  or  in-house  developed  software.  Here,  the  best  obtainable estimates of private-sector investment in software overall come from the United States National Income and Product Accounts data (NIPA 2023). In 2020, the national account data shows that in the  US,  private  firms  spent  $479.2  billion  on  software,  of  which  45%  ($215.5  billion)  was prepackaged. If we assume this is a consistent ratio for the rest of the world, then the total amount firms spent on software being used in 2020 was $3.4 trillion (= $1.54 trillion\/0.45). Combining this rough estimate with the demand side estimate of the value of OSS based on an average global wage ($8.8 trillion), this indicates firms would spend $12.2 trillion (=$3.4 trillion + $8.8 trillion), or three and a half times what they currently spend if they needed to pay in-house developers to write the OSS that they currently use for free.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"double","original_questions":[{"question":"What is the significance of JavaScript in the BuiltWith dataset according to the Harvard Business School's OSS report?","answer":"In the BuiltWith dataset, the supply side value is driven by JavaScript code, which acts as a sanity check since the focus was on JavaScript packages to proxy for OSS.

A  pervasive example is open source software (OSS), a global public good that plays a vital role in the economy and is foundational for most technology we use today. However, it is difficult to measure the value of OSS due to its non-pecuniary nature and lack of centralized usage tracking. Therefore, OSS remains largely unaccounted for in economic measures. Although prior studies have estimated the supply-side costs to recreate this software, a lack of data has hampered estimating the much larger demand-side (usage) value created by OSS. Therefore, to understand the complete economic and social value of widely-used OSS, we leverage unique global data from two complementary sources capturing  OSS  usage  by  millions  of  global  firms.  We  first  estimate  the  supply-side  value  by calculating the cost to recreate the most widely used OSS once. We then calculate the demandside value based on a replacement value for each firm that uses the software and would need to build it internally if OSS did not exist. We estimate the supply-side value of widely-used OSS is $4.15 billion, but that the demand-side value is much larger at $8.8 trillion. We find that firms would need to spend 3.5 times more on software than they currently do if OSS did not exist. The top six programming languages in our sample comprise 84% of the demand-side value of OSS. Further, 96% of the demand-side value is created by only 5% of OSS developers.\n\nJEL Classification:\n\nH4; O3; J0\n\nKeywords: Open-source software, global public good\n\nAcknowledgement: The authors are grateful for  financial  and  administrative  support  from  the Linux  Foundation  without  which  the  data  from  the  Census  would  not  have  otherwise  been available.

Introduction\n\nIn 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that 'software is eating the world' (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that 'open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,' (Jacks, 2022). Other recent studies have come to similar conclusions showing that open source software  (OSS)  -  software  whose  source  code  is  publicly  available  for  inspection,  use,  and modification and is often created in a decentralized manner and distributed for free - appears in 96% of codebases (Synopsys 2023), and that some commercial software consists of up to 99.9% freely available OSS (Musseau et al., 2022). Although in its early days OSS frequently copied features from existing proprietary software, OSS today includes cutting edge technology in various fields including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, big data, and analytics.  However, despite the increasing importance of OSS to all software (and therefore to the entire economy), measuring its impact has been elusive. Traditionally, to measure the value created by a good or service,  economists  multiply  the  price  ( p )  times  the  quantity  sold  ( q ).  However,  in  OSS, p is generally zero since the source code is publicly available, and q is  unknown due to the limited number of restrictions around how the code may be copied and reused. For example, if a company downloads  a  piece  of  OSS  from  a  public  code  repository,  it  may  copy  it  thousands  of  times internally (legally) and then share it with suppliers or customers (also legally), so public download data is insufficient. Although some recent studies have sought to estimate the value of p (discussed below), data for estimating q has been unavailable or intractable for anything more than just a handful of OSS packages. Using newly collected data from multiple sources, the goal of this paper is to provide estimates for both p and q and to use those to shine light on the question: What is the value of open source software?\n\nUnderstanding the value of OSS is of critical importance not only due to the role it plays in the economy, but also due to it being one of the most successful and impactful modern examples of the centuries old economic concept of 'the commons' which run the risk of meeting the fate known as 'the tragedy of the commons.' This concept can trace its roots as far back as the 4 th -century BC philosopher Aristotle who wrote 'That which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care. Men pay most attention to what is their own and care less for what is common.'  (Aristotle,  1981).  William  Forster  Lloyd  (1833)  resurfaced  the  idea  in  modern economic thought by highlighting the example of shared tracts of land used for cattle grazing by\n\nmultiple cattle herders who each had an incentive to overuse the shared resource. Garrett Hardin (1968)  brought  the  concept  into  the  broader  zeitgeist  when  he  wrote  an  article  discussing  the problem entitled 'The Tragedy of the Commons.' Building on this work, Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for her research highlighting paths to avoiding the tragedy of the commons through community coordination efforts that did not necessitate government enforced laws to manage and guard the commons (Ostrom 1990). The parallels between shared grazing lands and shared digital infrastructure are palpable - the availability of communal grass to feed cattle, and in turn feed people, was critical to the agrarian economy, and the ability to not have to recreate code that someone else has already written is critical to the modern economy. Further, in both contexts, despite knowing grass and code are critical inputs to the economy, measuring their actual value is difficult. And, as the renowned mathematician and physicist Lord Kelvin is believed to have said, 'If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.' And if you cannot improve and maintain it, such common goods may crumble under the weight of their own success as they are overused, but underinvested in (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021). Therefore, measuring the value OSS creates is crucial to the future health of the digital economy, and the rest of the economy that is built on top of it.\n\nImportantly, recent studies have attempted to address these measurement issues but fall short of capturing both the breadth and depth of OSS usage - a gap we seek to fill with this paper. For example, researchers have attempted to gain breadth by using novel methodologies to estimate the labor replacement value of the current corpus of OSS created in the United States at $38 billion in 2019 (Robbins et al., 2021) and that created in the European Union at €1 billion (Blind et al., 2021) by imputing the labor costs that it would have taken to rewrite existing OSS. Such efforts do a very good job at estimating what it would cost to replace all existing OSS if it disappeared tomorrow. However, the resultant estimates rely on two important assumptions. First, that all OSS is equally valuable from a usage standpoint, and second that the concept of OSS would still exist, and society would just need to rewrite the code once, thus addressing the aforementioned problem of a missing value for p , but not addressing the missing value of q . In a world where OSS did not exist at all, then each piece of OSS software would not need to be rewritten just once, but instead would need to be rewritten by every firm that used the software (assuming the firm could freely share the software within its boundaries). Other research (Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; MurcianoGoroff, Zhuo, and Greenstein, 2021) has gone deeper into this hypothetical, albeit in a narrow\n\nmanner, by only focusing on web servers (which are public facing on the Internet and can therefore be readily measured). Using different methods, both studies measure q for this one type of software and impute p by using a goods replacement value approach based on the prices for closed-source alternatives offered by firms. With data from the United States the resulting estimates show a value of  $2  billion  for  the  OSS  Apache  Web  Server  in  2012  (Greenstein  and  Nagle,  2014)  and  a combined value of $4.5 billion for Apache and the increasingly popular OSS web server nginx in 2018 (Murciano-Goroff, et al., 2021). However, although web servers are an important part of the OSS  ecosystem,  they  constitute  a  small  portion  of  it.  We  seek  to  build  upon  the  important contributions this existing research has made in an attempt to go both broad and deep to create a more complete measure of the value of OSS.\n\nTo consider the value of OSS in both a broad and deep manner, we use data from two primary sources that allow us to gain insights into the OSS used at tens of thousands of firms across the world. The first is the 'Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries' (Nagle et al., 2022). The Census II project utilized partnerships with multiple software composition analysis (SCA) firms to create various lists of the most widely used OSS. SCAs are hired to scan the codebases of a company to ensure they are not violating any OSS licenses and, as a byproduct, track all the OSS code used by their customers and the products they build. The Census II project aggregated data from multiple SCAs to build a dataset of OSS usage at tens of thousands of firms based  on  millions  of  data  points  (observations  of  OSS  usage).  The  second  data  source  is  the BuiltWith dataset, from which we leverage scans of nearly nine million websites to identify the underlying technology deployed by these websites, including OSS libraries. The BuiltWith data has been used in multiple academic studies (DeStefano &amp; Timmis 2023, Dushnitsky &amp; Stroube 2021, Koning et al.. 2022), but to our knowledge this is the first one to focus on OSS usage. The Census II data and the BuiltWith data are complementary as the former focuses on OSS that is built  into  the  software  a  company  sells,  while  the  latter  focuses  on  OSS  that  is  built  into  a company's website, thus reducing the chances of double-counting observations across the datasets. In aggregate, these two datasets combined create the most complete measurement of OSS usage ( q ) to date. Further, by focusing on OSS that is widely deployed and used by firms, rather than considering all the projects that exist in an OSS repository, we enhance the methodologies of prior studies by reducing the likelihood of measurement error stemming from projects that are posted as publicly available OSS but are not actually used in any practical manner. Not accounting for this\n\nmeasurement error would lead to overestimation of the actual value of OSS as projects that are widely used would be valued in the same way as projects that are not used at all.\n\nTo estimate p ,  we  follow  the  literature  discussed  above  and  use  the  labor  replacement value. First, we calculate the labor cost it would take an individual firm to recreate a given OSS package by measuring the number of lines of code within the package and then applying the Constructive Cost Model II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) - also known as COCOMO II to estimate the number of person-hours it would take to write the code from scratch. We then utilize global wage data from Salary Expert to get an accurate estimate of the labor costs a firm would incur if this piece of OSS did not exist. These costs can be combined with the q values from above at the OSS package level to estimate the combined value of all OSS from both the supply and demand sides.\n\nWe find a value ranging from $1.22 billion to $6.22 billion if we were to decide as a society to recreate all widely used OSS on the supply side. However, considering the actual usage of OSS leads to a demand-side value that is orders of magnitude larger and ranges from $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion, if each firm who used an OSS package had to recreate it from scratch (e.g., the concept of OSS did not exist). We document substantial heterogeneity of the value of OSS by programming  language  and  internal  vs  outward-facing  programming  efforts.  Further,  we  find considerable  heterogeneity  in  value  contributions  by  programmers  as  5%  of  programmers  are responsible for more than 90% of the value created on the supply- and demand- side. The data we use is arguably the most comprehensive source of data to measure the value created by firm usage of OSS at this time. However, as for any project, the evidence is not complete and we argue that we underestimate the value since our data, e.g., does not include operating systems, which are a substantial omitted category of OSS.\n\nThis study makes four important contributions to the academic literature, practitioners, and policy makers. First, it provides the most complete estimate of the value of widely used OSS to date  by  accounting  for  not  only  the  supply-side  of  OSS  (price  to  create  it),  but  also  for  the usage\/demand-side at a scale that has not been done before. While prior estimates of the value of OSS only went either broad (estimating the supply-side costs of a large swath of OSS) or deep (estimating the value created by one particular type of OSS), this study does both by using unique datasets that allow for a better understanding of the breadth and depth of OSS usage. Further, rather than measuring the value of all OSS, this study focuses on the value of OSS that is used by firms\n\nto create its products and websites, limiting the measurement error occurring in studies that are unable to account for which OSS is actually used in production. This contribution builds upon, and extends, important research (e.g., Blind et al., 2021; Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021; Robbins et al., 2021) that has sought to identify the value of this vital resource that contributes a great deal to the modern economy despite the difficulties measuring this contribution. In  doing  so,  it  adds  insights  to  a  long-running  discussion  related  to  the  impact  of  information technology (IT) on productivity (Brynjolfsson, 1993; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 1996; Nagle, 2019a; Solow, 1987) known as the 'productivity paradox' where IT investments can have limited impact on productivity statistics. This debate has continued into the emerging context of AI (Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson, 2018). Our work contributes to this conversation by highlighting a massive societal level cost-savings (and hence productivity enhancement) that is created by the existence of OSS.\n\nSecond, our research contributes methodological advances to the study of intangible capital by highlighting novel sources of data related to investments in OSS. Prior research has shown that intangible capital plays an increasingly important role in economic growth (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel,  2009)  and  firm  value  (Peters  and  Taylor,  2017),  but  it  often  goes  unmeasured  or misattributed (Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou, 2014). Further, we demonstrate how these data sources can be used to understand the true investments in software that a firm makes, and that which they would have to make if OSS did not exist.  This  is  valuable  as  investments  in  software  are  an increasingly important type of intangible capital that is driving innovation (Branstetter, Drev, and Kwon, 2019) and performance (Krishnan et al., 2000).\n\nThird, our results help highlight for firms and managers the importance of OSS to their production, and ideally add weight to arguments that users of OSS should not just free ride but also contribute to the creation and maintenance of OSS (e.g., Henkel, 2008; Nagle, 2018). Such contributions are a fraction of the costs that firms would incur if OSS did not exist and the active participation of OSS users in helping maintain the OSS they use is critical to the health and future well-being of the OSS ecosystem (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021; Zhang et al., 2019).\n\nFourth,  and  finally,  our  study  helps  inform  policymakers  who  have  recently  started  to understand  the  growing  importance  of  OSS  to  the  economy  and  taken  actions  to  support  the ecosystem (European Commission, 2020; Executive Order No. 14028, 2021). However, most of these efforts are related to securing the existing OSS ecosystem, which is quite important, but do\n\nnot go as far as supporting the creation of new OSS. Our results help shine light on the importance of OSS to the overall economy and add weight to calls for more societal support of this critical resource. Our results further show that the majority of the value created by OSS is created by a small  number  of  contributors.  Although  it  has  long  been  known  that  a  small  number  of  OSS contributors do most of the work, we add new insights that show this is even more true for the value creation of widely-used OSS projects and that societal support for these individuals is critical to the future success of OSS, and in turn, the economy.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the empirical setting and data. Section 3 discusses the methods including measurement challenges. In section 4, we estimate the value of open source software. Section 5 concludes.\n\nDocument 16: ## 5. Conclusion\n\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith. We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average value and distributed it across industries.\n\nIn this study we estimate the value of widely-used open source software globally with two unique datasets: the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data. We are able to estimate not only the supply side value of existing code (e.g., the cost it would take to rewrite each piece of widely-used OSS once) but also the demand side value for the private economy (e.g., the cost it would take for each company that uses a piece of OSS to rewrite it). While we do not focus on the long tail of OSS, we consider this an additional contribution of our study as focusing on OSS that is widely used allows us to more precisely understand the value created by OSS, rather than only measuring the  replacement  cost  for  all  OSS  (which  would  overestimate  the  true  value  since  many  OSS projects are not used in production code). However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n\nAdjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.  We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves.  Over  95%  percent  of  the  demand-side  value  is  generated  by  only  five  percent  of programmers, and those programmers contribute not only to a few widely used projects but to substantially more projects than the programmers that are engaged at the lower end of the value distribution.\n\nIn aggregate, our results show the substantial value that OSS contributes to the economy despite this value generally showing up as zero via direct measurement since prices equal zero and quantity is difficult to measure using public data alone. Our research lays the groundwork for future studies of not only OSS, but of all IT and its growing impact on the global economy.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"double","original_questions":[{"question":"What are the challenges in measuring the value of open source software (OSS) according to the Harvard Business School's OSS report?","answer":"The value of open source software (OSS) is difficult to assess due to its non-pecuniary nature and lack of centralized usage tracking.

The demand-side value of OSS is estimated to be between $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion, depending on the wage level of the programmers used. In comparison, global software revenue in 2020 was $531.7 billion, and private-sector investment in software in the US was $479.2 billion, with $215.5 billion being prepackaged software. Firms would spend $12.2 trillion if they needed to pay in-house developers to write the OSS they currently use for free.","reference_context":"Document 12: ## --- Table 1 about here ---\n\nTable  1  shows  descriptive  statistics  from  both  data  sets  separately.  The  inward-facing Census  (Panel  A)  contains  just  over  261.7  million  lines  of  code  with  72%  of  the  lines  being attributable to the top programming languages. The average package includes 142 thousand lines of code with a slightly lower average of 113 thousand lines of code for the subset of top languages. When considering the demand (usage) side, we observe that the Census packages were used over 2.7 million times while 92% of this usage is attributable to the top languages. The average package was used 1,472.4 times with a higher usage of around 1,497.5 for the top  languages.  For  the outward-facing  BuiltWith  data  we  find  similar  patterns,  but  at  different  levels.  The  packages included from BuiltWith include over 82 million lines of code, 71% of which are attributable to the  top  programming  languages.  The  average  package  within  the  BuiltWith  sample  has  111 thousand  lines  of  code  with  a  lower  average  of  around  80  thousand  lines  of  code  for  the  top languages. This is because our BuiltWith data primarily consists of JavaScript-based packages, which are often smaller than packages written in other languages. BuiltWith packages were used over 142 thousand times where 99.97% were attributable to the top languages. Next, we used these raw observations to calculate the value of all OSS through the labor market approach and estimated the value created from the supply and demand side.\n\n--- Table 2 about here ---\n\nTable 2 shows the estimates for the value of OSS based on the firm-relevant joint Census and BuiltWith sample. All estimates in Table 2 are based only on software languages classified in bucket  1  from  Table  A1,  which  are  the  most  likely  to  be  written  by  a  human  rather  than  a machine. 19 The first column contains estimates with wages from a low income country (India), the global  average  wage,  and  a  high  income  country  (United  States  of  America),  respectively  (as described above). To reproduce all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the idea of OSS still exists, but all current OSS is deleted and needs to be coded from scratch), using programmers at the average developer wage from India, it would require an investment of $1.22 billion. In contrast, if we use the average developer wage from the United States, then reproducing all widely-used OSS would require  an  investment  of  $6.22  billion.  Using  a  pool  of  programmers  from  across  the  world, weighed based on the existing geographic contributions to OSS as discussed above, would lead to an investment somewhere in between the low and high-income country, $4.15 billion. It is useful to compare these numbers to those from similar studies to understand differences in valuing all OSS (prior studies) versus that which is widely used (our study). Robbins et al. (2021) and Blind et al. (2021) use a method similar to ours and estimate that the value of OSS created in the US is $38 billion in 2019 and that created in the EU is €1 billion in 2018. Wachs et al. (2022) show that roughly 50% of OSS contributions come from the US and EU combined. In aggregate, that would lead these studies to give a global value of OSS of $78 billion. Thus, our middle estimate of a supply-side value of $4.15 billion for only firm-oriented and widely used OSS is a credible lowerbound and highlights the higher estimations of the total of supply-side value of OSS when not considering whether or not a given OSS package is widely used. This further indicates that the supply-side value of the most widely used OSS is roughly 5.5% of the supply-side value of all OSS.\n\nThe second column in Table 2 contains the demand side estimates based on the labor market approach. We find that if firms had to recreate all OSS packages they used (e.g., OSS itself no longer existed and every firm that used an OSS package had to recreate it), then the entire cost would amount to between $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion using labor from the low wage or high wage country only, respectively. A pool of programmers across the globe could recreate all of OSS that is being widely used for a cost of approximately $8.80 trillion. Interpreting this number is\n\n19 Tables in the appendix show the equivalent values from Table 2 when including software language buckets 1 and 2 (Table A3) and all three software language buckets (Table A4).\n\nslightly more complicated but still feasible. According to a Statista (2023) report, global software revenue in 2020 (the same year as our data) was $531.7 billion. However, this represents a flow, not a stock, of software. Relying on government estimates that software fully depreciates over three years, we can do a back of the envelope calculation and consider the purchase value of the full stock of prepackaged software used in 2020 as the aggregate of that sold from 2018 to 2020, which is $1.54 trillion. Further, this represents only the expenditure on prepackaged software and does  not  include  custom  purchased  or  in-house  developed  software.  Here,  the  best  obtainable estimates of private-sector investment in software overall come from the United States National Income and Product Accounts data (NIPA 2023). In 2020, the national account data shows that in the  US,  private  firms  spent  $479.2  billion  on  software,  of  which  45%  ($215.5  billion)  was prepackaged. If we assume this is a consistent ratio for the rest of the world, then the total amount firms spent on software being used in 2020 was $3.4 trillion (= $1.54 trillion\/0.45). Combining this rough estimate with the demand side estimate of the value of OSS based on an average global wage ($8.8 trillion), this indicates firms would spend $12.2 trillion (=$3.4 trillion + $8.8 trillion), or three and a half times what they currently spend if they needed to pay in-house developers to write the OSS that they currently use for free.\n\nDocument 14: ## --- Figure 2 about here ---\n\nFigure 2 splits the OSS value estimates for each language by our inward facing (Census) and outward facing (BuiltWith) data sources. Panel A and Panel B focus on the supply and demand side estimation for the Census. We obtain a similar pattern that has been established already in the aggregate when pooling both data sources (Figure 1) albeit the impact of JavaScript is substantially lower.  On  the  supply  side  of  the  Census  in  Panel  A,  Java  has  the  second-highest  value  while JavaScript  code  from  the  Census  contributes  to  a  substantially  lower  value  to  the  aggregate. Similarly, the supply side values of C, Python, and Typescript are mainly driven by the Census. From the demand side Panel B we find that Go is the most popular language for inward facing code while all other languages appear to be negligible in relative terms.\n\nFigure 2, Panel C and Panel D show the supply and demand side values for the BuiltWith dataset. The supply side value in Panel C clearly indicates that the value from the BuiltWith sample is driven by JavaScript code, which is a good sanity check since we focused on JavaScript packages to proxy for OSS in the BuiltWith sample, as discussed above. The second highest value is created by TypeScript which is reassuring since it is a superset of JavaScript. Panel D shows a similar pattern  on  the  usage  side  where  most  of  the  value  arises  from  JavaScript  while  TypeScript  is trailing at the second spot as well. The other languages contribute only marginal amounts to the supply and demand side values. Overall, these findings are broadly consistent with the main use cases of the various languages (web programming vs. application programming) and an idea that languages through which value are generated are not necessarily identical to languages that are used by the general public.\n\n--- Figure 3 about here ---\n\nFigure 3 shows the demand-side value of OSS across industries by NAICS 2-digit codes using the BuiltWith online data. 20 This can be interpreted as the value each of these industries receive because OSS exists. The industry with the highest usage value of around $43 billion is 'Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.' 'Retail Trade' as well as 'Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services' make up another large part of the demand-side externally facing value of OSS with $36 billion and $35 billion, respectively. In contrast, industries that constitute just a small portion of the value are 'Mining, Quarrying, and Oil  and  Gas  Extraction',  'Utilities',  'Agriculture,  Forestry,  Fishing,  and  Hunting.'  The  latter industries are classical non-service sector industries and as such software is expected to play less of a role there.\n\nDocument 16: ## 5. Conclusion\n\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith.

However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n\nAdjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.  We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves.  Over  95%  percent  of  the  demand-side  value  is  generated  by  only  five  percent  of programmers, and those programmers contribute not only to a few widely used projects but to substantially more projects than the programmers that are engaged at the lower end of the value distribution.\n\nIn aggregate, our results show the substantial value that OSS contributes to the economy despite this value generally showing up as zero via direct measurement since prices equal zero and quantity is difficult to measure using public data alone. Our research lays the groundwork for future studies of not only OSS, but of all IT and its growing impact on the global economy.\n\nDocument 9: ## 3.1 Labor market approach\n\nFor the labor market approach, we estimate the value of OSS by calculating the replacement value of a package. We ask how much it would cost to reproduce the package by hiring a programmer and paying them a competitive market wage. To estimate this supply-side value ( 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; ) , we take the complete list of OSS packages discussed above, and then count the lines of code in each unique\n\n14 In an alternative version, we use a mixture of a labor and goods market approach that is more closely aligned with Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff, et al (2021). However, applying this method in our setting requires numerous additional assumptions due to data constraints. For simplicity we call it the goods market approach for which we provide the details and statistics, as well as the limitations in Appendix A.\n\npackage. 15 For each unique package,  , we calculate the value and then sum over all these values i to obtain the total value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nIn this calculation, we implicitly do not incorporate any production externalities since we assume that there is no spillover knowledge from one package to the next that would lower the cost of programming. 16 This methodology is similar to that used by other papers that estimate the supply-side costs of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021).\n\nWe then calculate the demand-side value of OSS by incorporating the usage information ( Q) for each package:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nHere, we do not incorporate consumption externalities, i.e., we do not allow a benefit to arise for the general public when a package has been created and we further make sure that each firm is only replacing a package they use once, since a replaced package can be used within a firm as a club good (e.g., see Cornes and Sandler, 1996). The value 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost to rewrite all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the concept of OSS still exists, but all of these packages needed to be rewritten from scratch), while the value 𝑉 + \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost for each firm that uses one of these OSS packages to pay a developer to rewrite those packages (e.g., OSS itself no longer exists).\n\nFor both the supply and demand models, we obtain the dollar-value for each package ( 𝑃 ( ) via the Constructive Cost Model II, also abbreviated as COCOMO II (Boehm 1984, Boehm et al. 2009). The model has previously been used by the United States Department of Defense to estimate software project costs as well as in prior research estimating the value of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021). It is a highly flexible model that allows us to create non-linear transformations of lines of code to dollar-values. It uses the following modelling equation:\n\n15 We use only the pure lines of code excluding documentation lines and empty lines. Hence, we underestimate the true value of recreating each package.\n\n16 Similar to a representative agent model (e.g. see Williamson 2006), one may think of each package being reproduced by separate programmers who are identical replicas of each other (and therefore have the same skill level, but do not become more efficient via learning).\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n( (\n\nwhere 𝐿 represents the lines of codes in thousands and E the effort in person-month units for each project  . Consistent with Blind et al. (2021), we use the default parameter values for i 𝛼 , 𝛽 and 𝜂. The parameters 𝛼 𝛽 , are non-linear adjustment factors set to 2.94, and 1.0997 respectively . The parameter 𝜂 is an effort-adjustment factor which can be modified to incorporate subjective assessments of product, hardware, personnel, and project attributes. Since we do not have a prior for each project, we set 𝜂 to the default value of one. To obtain the price ( 𝑃 ( ) of each OSS project, we  then  multiply  the  results  of  equation  (3)  by  the  weighted  global  wage  that  an  average programmer would obtain on the open market. To calculate a global wage, we include the base monthly salaries of software developers from Salary Expert for the top 30 countries in terms of their GitHub developer counts in 2021 (Wachs et al., 2022). 17 The weight of each country is its share of active GitHub contributors over the total contributors in the top 30 countries. We further create bounds by using a low-wage (India) and high-wage (USA) labor market for the wage to better understand how the value would vary by the pool of programmers used to recreate all of OSS. 18","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"double","original_questions":[{"question":"What is the estimated cost to reproduce all widely-used OSS using programmers from different income countries?","answer":"To reproduce all widely-used OSS using programmers at the average developer wage from India, it would require an investment of $1.22 billion.

Introduction\n\nIn 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that 'software is eating the world' (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that 'open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,' (Jacks, 2022). Other recent studies have come to similar conclusions showing that open source software  (OSS)  -  software  whose  source  code  is  publicly  available  for  inspection,  use,  and modification and is often created in a decentralized manner and distributed for free - appears in 96% of codebases (Synopsys 2023), and that some commercial software consists of up to 99.9% freely available OSS (Musseau et al., 2022). Although in its early days OSS frequently copied features from existing proprietary software, OSS today includes cutting edge technology in various fields including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, big data, and analytics.  However, despite the increasing importance of OSS to all software (and therefore to the entire economy), measuring its impact has been elusive. Traditionally, to measure the value created by a good or service,  economists  multiply  the  price  ( p )  times  the  quantity  sold  ( q ).  However,  in  OSS, p is generally zero since the source code is publicly available, and q is  unknown due to the limited number of restrictions around how the code may be copied and reused. For example, if a company downloads  a  piece  of  OSS  from  a  public  code  repository,  it  may  copy  it  thousands  of  times internally (legally) and then share it with suppliers or customers (also legally), so public download data is insufficient. Although some recent studies have sought to estimate the value of p (discussed below), data for estimating q has been unavailable or intractable for anything more than just a handful of OSS packages. Using newly collected data from multiple sources, the goal of this paper is to provide estimates for both p and q and to use those to shine light on the question: What is the value of open source software?\n\nUnderstanding the value of OSS is of critical importance not only due to the role it plays in the economy, but also due to it being one of the most successful and impactful modern examples of the centuries old economic concept of 'the commons' which run the risk of meeting the fate known as 'the tragedy of the commons.' This concept can trace its roots as far back as the 4 th -century BC philosopher Aristotle who wrote 'That which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care. Men pay most attention to what is their own and care less for what is common.'  (Aristotle,  1981).  William  Forster  Lloyd  (1833)  resurfaced  the  idea  in  modern economic thought by highlighting the example of shared tracts of land used for cattle grazing by\n\nmultiple cattle herders who each had an incentive to overuse the shared resource. Garrett Hardin (1968)  brought  the  concept  into  the  broader  zeitgeist  when  he  wrote  an  article  discussing  the problem entitled 'The Tragedy of the Commons.' Building on this work, Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for her research highlighting paths to avoiding the tragedy of the commons through community coordination efforts that did not necessitate government enforced laws to manage and guard the commons (Ostrom 1990). The parallels between shared grazing lands and shared digital infrastructure are palpable - the availability of communal grass to feed cattle, and in turn feed people, was critical to the agrarian economy, and the ability to not have to recreate code that someone else has already written is critical to the modern economy. Further, in both contexts, despite knowing grass and code are critical inputs to the economy, measuring their actual value is difficult. And, as the renowned mathematician and physicist Lord Kelvin is believed to have said, 'If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.' And if you cannot improve and maintain it, such common goods may crumble under the weight of their own success as they are overused, but underinvested in (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021). Therefore, measuring the value OSS creates is crucial to the future health of the digital economy, and the rest of the economy that is built on top of it.\n\nImportantly, recent studies have attempted to address these measurement issues but fall short of capturing both the breadth and depth of OSS usage - a gap we seek to fill with this paper. For example, researchers have attempted to gain breadth by using novel methodologies to estimate the labor replacement value of the current corpus of OSS created in the United States at $38 billion in 2019 (Robbins et al., 2021) and that created in the European Union at €1 billion (Blind et al., 2021) by imputing the labor costs that it would have taken to rewrite existing OSS. Such efforts do a very good job at estimating what it would cost to replace all existing OSS if it disappeared tomorrow. However, the resultant estimates rely on two important assumptions. First, that all OSS is equally valuable from a usage standpoint, and second that the concept of OSS would still exist, and society would just need to rewrite the code once, thus addressing the aforementioned problem of a missing value for p , but not addressing the missing value of q . In a world where OSS did not exist at all, then each piece of OSS software would not need to be rewritten just once, but instead would need to be rewritten by every firm that used the software (assuming the firm could freely share the software within its boundaries). Other research (Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; MurcianoGoroff, Zhuo, and Greenstein, 2021) has gone deeper into this hypothetical, albeit in a narrow\n\nmanner, by only focusing on web servers (which are public facing on the Internet and can therefore be readily measured). Using different methods, both studies measure q for this one type of software and impute p by using a goods replacement value approach based on the prices for closed-source alternatives offered by firms. With data from the United States the resulting estimates show a value of  $2  billion  for  the  OSS  Apache  Web  Server  in  2012  (Greenstein  and  Nagle,  2014)  and  a combined value of $4.5 billion for Apache and the increasingly popular OSS web server nginx in 2018 (Murciano-Goroff, et al., 2021). However, although web servers are an important part of the OSS  ecosystem,  they  constitute  a  small  portion  of  it.  We  seek  to  build  upon  the  important contributions this existing research has made in an attempt to go both broad and deep to create a more complete measure of the value of OSS.\n\nTo consider the value of OSS in both a broad and deep manner, we use data from two primary sources that allow us to gain insights into the OSS used at tens of thousands of firms across the world. The first is the 'Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries' (Nagle et al., 2022). The Census II project utilized partnerships with multiple software composition analysis (SCA) firms to create various lists of the most widely used OSS. SCAs are hired to scan the codebases of a company to ensure they are not violating any OSS licenses and, as a byproduct, track all the OSS code used by their customers and the products they build. The Census II project aggregated data from multiple SCAs to build a dataset of OSS usage at tens of thousands of firms based  on  millions  of  data  points  (observations  of  OSS  usage).  The  second  data  source  is  the BuiltWith dataset, from which we leverage scans of nearly nine million websites to identify the underlying technology deployed by these websites, including OSS libraries. The BuiltWith data has been used in multiple academic studies (DeStefano &amp; Timmis 2023, Dushnitsky &amp; Stroube 2021, Koning et al.. 2022), but to our knowledge this is the first one to focus on OSS usage. The Census II data and the BuiltWith data are complementary as the former focuses on OSS that is built  into  the  software  a  company  sells,  while  the  latter  focuses  on  OSS  that  is  built  into  a company's website, thus reducing the chances of double-counting observations across the datasets. In aggregate, these two datasets combined create the most complete measurement of OSS usage ( q ) to date. Further, by focusing on OSS that is widely deployed and used by firms, rather than considering all the projects that exist in an OSS repository, we enhance the methodologies of prior studies by reducing the likelihood of measurement error stemming from projects that are posted as publicly available OSS but are not actually used in any practical manner. Not accounting for this\n\nmeasurement error would lead to overestimation of the actual value of OSS as projects that are widely used would be valued in the same way as projects that are not used at all.\n\nTo estimate p ,  we  follow  the  literature  discussed  above  and  use  the  labor  replacement value. First, we calculate the labor cost it would take an individual firm to recreate a given OSS package by measuring the number of lines of code within the package and then applying the Constructive Cost Model II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) - also known as COCOMO II to estimate the number of person-hours it would take to write the code from scratch. We then utilize global wage data from Salary Expert to get an accurate estimate of the labor costs a firm would incur if this piece of OSS did not exist. These costs can be combined with the q values from above at the OSS package level to estimate the combined value of all OSS from both the supply and demand sides.\n\nWe find a value ranging from $1.22 billion to $6.22 billion if we were to decide as a society to recreate all widely used OSS on the supply side. However, considering the actual usage of OSS leads to a demand-side value that is orders of magnitude larger and ranges from $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion, if each firm who used an OSS package had to recreate it from scratch (e.g., the concept of OSS did not exist). We document substantial heterogeneity of the value of OSS by programming  language  and  internal  vs  outward-facing  programming  efforts.  Further,  we  find considerable  heterogeneity  in  value  contributions  by  programmers  as  5%  of  programmers  are responsible for more than 90% of the value created on the supply- and demand- side. The data we use is arguably the most comprehensive source of data to measure the value created by firm usage of OSS at this time. However, as for any project, the evidence is not complete and we argue that we underestimate the value since our data, e.g., does not include operating systems, which are a substantial omitted category of OSS.\n\nThis study makes four important contributions to the academic literature, practitioners, and policy makers. First, it provides the most complete estimate of the value of widely used OSS to date  by  accounting  for  not  only  the  supply-side  of  OSS  (price  to  create  it),  but  also  for  the usage\/demand-side at a scale that has not been done before. While prior estimates of the value of OSS only went either broad (estimating the supply-side costs of a large swath of OSS) or deep (estimating the value created by one particular type of OSS), this study does both by using unique datasets that allow for a better understanding of the breadth and depth of OSS usage. Further, rather than measuring the value of all OSS, this study focuses on the value of OSS that is used by firms\n\nto create its products and websites, limiting the measurement error occurring in studies that are unable to account for which OSS is actually used in production. This contribution builds upon, and extends, important research (e.g., Blind et al., 2021; Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021; Robbins et al., 2021) that has sought to identify the value of this vital resource that contributes a great deal to the modern economy despite the difficulties measuring this contribution. In  doing  so,  it  adds  insights  to  a  long-running  discussion  related  to  the  impact  of  information technology (IT) on productivity (Brynjolfsson, 1993; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 1996; Nagle, 2019a; Solow, 1987) known as the 'productivity paradox' where IT investments can have limited impact on productivity statistics. This debate has continued into the emerging context of AI (Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson, 2018). Our work contributes to this conversation by highlighting a massive societal level cost-savings (and hence productivity enhancement) that is created by the existence of OSS.\n\nSecond, our research contributes methodological advances to the study of intangible capital by highlighting novel sources of data related to investments in OSS. Prior research has shown that intangible capital plays an increasingly important role in economic growth (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel,  2009)  and  firm  value  (Peters  and  Taylor,  2017),  but  it  often  goes  unmeasured  or misattributed (Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou, 2014). Further, we demonstrate how these data sources can be used to understand the true investments in software that a firm makes, and that which they would have to make if OSS did not exist.  This  is  valuable  as  investments  in  software  are  an increasingly important type of intangible capital that is driving innovation (Branstetter, Drev, and Kwon, 2019) and performance (Krishnan et al., 2000).\n\nThird, our results help highlight for firms and managers the importance of OSS to their production, and ideally add weight to arguments that users of OSS should not just free ride but also contribute to the creation and maintenance of OSS (e.g., Henkel, 2008; Nagle, 2018). Such contributions are a fraction of the costs that firms would incur if OSS did not exist and the active participation of OSS users in helping maintain the OSS they use is critical to the health and future well-being of the OSS ecosystem (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021; Zhang et al., 2019).\n\nFourth,  and  finally,  our  study  helps  inform  policymakers  who  have  recently  started  to understand  the  growing  importance  of  OSS  to  the  economy  and  taken  actions  to  support  the ecosystem (European Commission, 2020; Executive Order No. 14028, 2021). However, most of these efforts are related to securing the existing OSS ecosystem, which is quite important, but do\n\nnot go as far as supporting the creation of new OSS. Our results help shine light on the importance of OSS to the overall economy and add weight to calls for more societal support of this critical resource. Our results further show that the majority of the value created by OSS is created by a small  number  of  contributors.  Although  it  has  long  been  known  that  a  small  number  of  OSS contributors do most of the work, we add new insights that show this is even more true for the value creation of widely-used OSS projects and that societal support for these individuals is critical to the future success of OSS, and in turn, the economy.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the empirical setting and data. Section 3 discusses the methods including measurement challenges. In section 4, we estimate the value of open source software. Section 5 concludes.\n\nDocument 16: ## 5. Conclusion\n\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith. We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average value and distributed it across industries.\n\nIn this study we estimate the value of widely-used open source software globally with two unique datasets: the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data. We are able to estimate not only the supply side value of existing code (e.g., the cost it would take to rewrite each piece of widely-used OSS once) but also the demand side value for the private economy (e.g., the cost it would take for each company that uses a piece of OSS to rewrite it). While we do not focus on the long tail of OSS, we consider this an additional contribution of our study as focusing on OSS that is widely used allows us to more precisely understand the value created by OSS, rather than only measuring the  replacement  cost  for  all  OSS  (which  would  overestimate  the  true  value  since  many  OSS projects are not used in production code). However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n\nAdjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.  We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves.  Over  95%  percent  of  the  demand-side  value  is  generated  by  only  five  percent  of programmers, and those programmers contribute not only to a few widely used projects but to substantially more projects than the programmers that are engaged at the lower end of the value distribution.\n\nIn aggregate, our results show the substantial value that OSS contributes to the economy despite this value generally showing up as zero via direct measurement since prices equal zero and quantity is difficult to measure using public data alone. Our research lays the groundwork for future studies of not only OSS, but of all IT and its growing impact on the global economy.\n\nDocument 5: ## Abstract\n\nThe  value  of  a  non-pecuniary  (free)  product  is  inherently  difficult  to  assess.  A  pervasive example is open source software (OSS), a global public good that plays a vital role in the economy and is foundational for most technology we use today. However, it is difficult to measure the value of OSS due to its non-pecuniary nature and lack of centralized usage tracking. Therefore, OSS remains largely unaccounted for in economic measures. Although prior studies have estimated the supply-side costs to recreate this software, a lack of data has hampered estimating the much larger demand-side (usage) value created by OSS. Therefore, to understand the complete economic and social value of widely-used OSS, we leverage unique global data from two complementary sources capturing  OSS  usage  by  millions  of  global  firms.  We  first  estimate  the  supply-side  value  by calculating the cost to recreate the most widely used OSS once. We then calculate the demandside value based on a replacement value for each firm that uses the software and would need to build it internally if OSS did not exist. We estimate the supply-side value of widely-used OSS is $4.15 billion, but that the demand-side value is much larger at $8.8 trillion. We find that firms would need to spend 3.5 times more on software than they currently do if OSS did not exist. The top six programming languages in our sample comprise 84% of the demand-side value of OSS. Further, 96% of the demand-side value is created by only 5% of OSS developers.\n\nJEL Classification:\n\nH4; O3; J0\n\nKeywords: Open-source software, global public good\n\nAcknowledgement: The authors are grateful for  financial  and  administrative  support  from  the Linux  Foundation  without  which  the  data  from  the  Census  would  not  have  otherwise  been available.

Empirical Setting and Data\n\nAlthough the concept of free and open software has existed since the 1950's, it became more popular in the 1980's due to the efforts of Richard Stallman and his launch of the GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation (Maracke, 2019). However, it was in the 1990's that OSS took off after Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel, a now widely adopted OSS operating system (Tozzi, 2016). Today, OSS is considered a key building block of the digital economy and is widely used by software developers in everything from phones to cars to refrigerators to cutting-edge AI (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021).\n\nWe use two complementary main data sources to estimate the value of OSS. The first is the Census and is inward facing. It allows us to identify OSS code that goes into products that firms create. The second dataset is BuiltWith and is outward facing, allowing us to identify OSS code  that  consumers  directly  interact  with  through  firm  websites.  Since  the  raw  data  in  both datasets only contains package names, version numbers, and package manager names, and does not  contain  any  source  code  related  information,  we  first  obtain  the  publicly  accessible  code repository for each package which includes package-level information including the lines of code and  the  programming  languages  used.  One  may  worry  about  double-counting  for  the  value calculations as a result of using two separate datasets. However, the overlap of both the Census and  the  BuiltWith  sample  is  very  small:  there  are  only  18  packages  found  in  both  datasets. Moreover, it is unlikely that double counting is a concern as the two datasets capture different dimensions of OSS usage: the Census captures packaged software whose usage is inward-facing while BuiltWith captures usage in websites that are outward-facing. Finally, as a supplementary\n\ndataset, we use GHTorrent, a detailed history of OSS-related activity on GitHub, the most popular OSS hosting platform and a commonly used data source for studies of OSS (e.g., Burton et al, 2017; Conti, Peukert, and Roche, 2023; Fackler, Hofmann, and Laurentsyeva, 2023; Kim, 2020; Tang, Wang, &amp; Tong, 2023). This detailed historical data allows us to go deeper into how the value  of  OSS  is  created  by  better  understanding  the  dispersion  of  the  contributions  across individual OSS developers. We describe the details of all three data sources and their preparation for estimation below.\n\nCensus. The  Census  II  of  Free  and  Open  Source  Software  (here:  Census)  was  jointly undertaken by the Linux Foundation and the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (Nagle et  al.,  2022). 1 The  Census  was  created  via  the  aggregation  of  data  from  three  major  software composition analysis (SCA) firms with thousands of clients across the globe. SCAs are hired to scan the codebase of a client and gather the OSS usage embedded in their proprietary software to ensure they are not violating any OSS license agreements.  Frequently this takes place as part of 2 the due diligence process related to mergers and acquisitions. Unlike other OSS demand measures available from public sources such as package download counts and code changes, the way this data was collected ensures that we observe the precise amount and type of internal OSS usage of the firms. In addition, it allows us to trace the dependencies each package relies on, so that we can observe the indirect OSS usage that is commonly hidden and difficult to obtain.  The result is over 3 2.7 million observations of OSS packages being used within products created by the SCA client firms for the calendar year 2020 (January 1 to December 31, 2020). 4\n\nThe Census project standardized package names based on the naming system of libraries.io -  a  widely  used  site  maintained  by  Tidelift  that  organizes  information  about  more  than  eight million open source packages. The Census focused on the top 2,000 packages based on usage\n\n1 The precise methodologies for the data collection and aggregation are detailed in the Census report by Nagle et al (2022).\n\n2 OSS usage licenses vary a great deal and while some licenses are very open and allow the code to be reused in any manner, including within proprietary code that will be made available for sale at a non-zero price, other licenses restrict reuse to only be allowed if the resultant code is released under the same OSS license (known as copyleft). A detailed discussion of OSS licenses can be found in Lerner and Tirole (2005) and Almeida et al (2017).\n\n3 Indirect OSS usage is captured by dependency analysis and is necessary to accurately measure the full breadth of the OSS a firm relies on. For example, if a firm's proprietary code calls OSS package A, but package A, in turn, calls package B, then only looking at the direct calls would miss that package B was a required building block for the firm's proprietary code.\n\n4 The Census defines an OSS package as 'a unit of software that can be installed and managed by a package manager,' and  defines  a  package  manager  as  'software  that  automates  the  process  of  installing  and  otherwise  managing packages' (Nagle et al, 2022).\n\nreported from the three of the most prominent SCA vendors to identify the most widely used OSS rather  than  the  long-tail  of  the  usage  distribution.  This  led  to  packages  with  less  than  five observations  of  usage  being  dropped.  Since  packages  written  in  the  JavaScript  programming language, and usually hosted on the Node Package Manager (NPM), are generally smaller (fewer lines  of  code)  than  packages  in  other  languages  and  therefore  frequently  have  higher  usage numbers (since developers must include many small packages instead of a few large packages), the Census separately selected the top 1,000 NPM packages and the top 1,000 non-NPM hosted packages.\n\nThis final dataset covers 70% of the total usage of OSS observed in the raw data of the census.   For  each  of  these  2,000  OSS  packages  in  the  Census,  we  identified  the  raw  code 5 maintained on GitHub, the most widely used platform for hosting OSS.  We first attempted to 6 obtain the GitHub repository uniform resource locator (URL) for each package from libraries.io. We were able to match 1,657 packages to repositories via this initial method.  For URLs without 7 a  matching  repository,  we  performed  Google  searches  loosely  following  the  method  in  Singh (2020). More specifically, for each unmatched package, we used the Google API to search for the package name and 'GitHub Repository' and treated the first GitHub repository URL in the results as  its  best  matched  GitHub  URL.   This  resulted  in  an  additional  174  packages  matched  to  a 8 repository. Finally, we manually searched for URLs for the remaining 169 packages to identify the relevant repository. This entire process resulted in matching 1,840 out of the 2,000 Census packages to a code repository with the raw source code for the package. The unmatched packages were determined to have been either removed from GitHub or became proprietary (and thus the original source code was no longer available) and hence, the manual search allowed us to drop\n\n5 The packages that made up the remaining 30% of the full Census data in the long-tail usage distribution were not shared in the final report and therefore cannot be included in our analysis.\n\n6 GitHub  is  a  hosting  and  collaboration  platform  that  contributors  can  use  to  coordinate  the  development  and distribution of OSS projects. Founded in 2008, GitHub has become the largest hub for OSS development in the world. In January 2023, GitHub had more than 370 million repositories and over 100 million developers. In addition to personal users, a wide range of private firms actively use the GitHub platform, including Microsoft (which bought GitHub in 2018), Facebook, Google, and numerous other small and large firms.\n\n7 We attempted to access all repository URLs obtained as a sanity check to ensure they are in working condition. For those we could not access on GitHub, we manually found the correct URLs.\n\n8 As a robustness check, we randomly selected 50 package-repository matches derived from the Google Search method and we checked them by hand. All matches were manually confirmed to be correct providing additional support for the automated matching method.\n\nthese 160 unmatched packages (less than 8% of the Census sample of 2,000) with high confidence from our analysis.\n\nBuiltWith. The BuiltWith data contains scans of all public websites across the globe and identifies the technologies they use. Unlike the inward facing Census data which focus on the usage of OSS, the BuiltWith data scan for the use of both proprietary and OSS in firm websites without explicit differentiation. To separate OSS from proprietary software in BuiltWith, we turn to the subset of all open source web development software in the technology category that includes \"JavaScript and its libraries,\" which generates 778 observations corresponding to the NPM OSS category  in  the  Census  data.  There  are  two  reasons  for  this  sampling  choice.  First,  this  given category is constructed by BuiltWith and we use it as a proxy for OSS to separate it from pecuniary software.  Second,  JavaScript,  one  of  the  core  technologies  for  building  websites,  is  the  most popular programming language by usage on GitHub (GitHub, 2022) and thus enables us to capture the most important OSS from the demand side perspective. The scans include 8.8 million unique websites and 72.8 million corresponding observations of OSS usage from January 1 to November 16, 2020. Further, to ensure that we measure the value of OSS usage generated by the private sector,  we  match  the  adopting  domains  of  the  JavaScript-related  OSS  from  BuiltWith  with company websites recorded in Orbis, Compustat, and PitchBook, three commonly used databases of corporate activity that capture registered businesses across the world. Performing this match ensures that OSS used by non-commercial websites (e.g., an individual person's personal website) is excluded in our analysis. This results in a match-rate of 38.6%, which corresponds to around 3.4 million websites of distinct firms.\n\nFor the BuiltWith data, we cannot employ the first method we use for the Census (using libraries.io to help identify the repository URL) since only the technology names associated with the  packages  were  provided  by  BuiltWith,  and  other  information  (e.g.,  package  and  package manager  names)  is  not  included. 9 Hence,  we  start  by  performing  the  Google  Search  method mentioned above which results in a match of 695 packages to repositories. We then manually searched the Github URLs for 83 of the remaining unmatched packages, resulting in an addition of 46 packages. In total, for the BuiltWith data we were able to identify 741 out of 778 package-\n\n9 Since the package and package manager names are missing, a precise match using libraries.io was not feasible. Technology names are product names intended for customers and can be less technical and precise than the package names for internal development purposes. Thus, using technology names in a libraries.io search could cause significant ambiguity.\n\nrepository matches. As with the Census data, the remaining 37 unmatched packages (less than 5%) are dropped from our analysis because they had been deleted from GitHub.\n\nGHTorrent database. To obtain measures of the dispersion of the OSS value creation, we utilize  the  GHTorrent  database,  which  contains  the  entire  activity  history  on  GitHub  using GitHub's Representational State Transfer (REST) application programming interface (API). We leveraged  its  records  of  GitHub  repositories,  developer-level  commits,  and  developer  public profile information to estimate the contribution of each developer. We narrowed the sample for our developer contribution analysis in two steps. First, we winnowed the GitHub repositories and their  commits  from  GHTorrent  based  on  the  repository  URLs  of  our  joint  Census-BuiltWith sample. 10 Second, we focus on human contributions to OSS by removing approximately eight thousand (12%) GitHub contributors that we considered to be robots. 11 The final sample contains around sixty thousand developers and 2.3 million commits.\n\nTo prepare these three datasets for estimation, we first identified the number of lines of code and the programming languages used for each package using the OSS packages pygount (to count  the  number  of  lines  of  code)  and  linguist  (to  identify  programming  languages). 12 We categorize each distinct language into one of three different buckets moving from more likely human-written to more likely machine-written (see Table A1). Bucket 1 contains programming and markup languages (which are most likely to be human-written), bucket 3 contains data (most likely to be machine-written), and bucket 2 contains anything in between, such as config files and batch processing (which are sometimes human-written and sometimes machine-written, but it is difficult to tell based purely on looking at the code). 13 For our primary estimation we only use bucket 1 while providing robustness checks for buckets 2 and 3 in the Appendix, and thus our results represent a lower bound. Finally, for some analyses we dig deeper and show the top 5 programming languages (as classified by GitHub, 2022 for the year 2020; the year our data is from). The top 5 programming languages contain C (including C# and C++), Java, JavaScript,\n\n10 The match rate is over 96%, with the unmatched repositories accounting for only 0.15% of our calculated OSS demand value discussed below.\n\n11 The filtering is based on the 'fake user' classification by GHTorrent, as well as any usernames containing words 'bot' or 'robot', surrounded by special characters. This method is more conservative than other methods of bot detection  like  that  used  in  the  GitHub  Innovation  Graph  (https:\/\/innovationgraph.github.com\/),  which  rely  on  a monthly commit frequency threshold.\n\n12 https:\/\/pypi.org\/project\/pygount\/ and https:\/\/github.com\/github-linguist\/linguist\n\n13 Note that our focus is the cost to recreate OSS code written by humans, not robots. However, directly removing all OSS contributions from robot accounts is infeasible here, because we cannot observe the exact lines of code written by the robot accounts on GitHub.\n\nPython, and Typescript. We also add Go to this list of top languages since it is an increasingly widely used language in OSS.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"double","original_questions":[{"question":"What are the two main data sources used to estimate the value of widely-used open source software in the Harvard Business School's OSS report?","answer":"The two main data sources used to estimate the value of widely-used open source software in the report are the 'Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries' and the BuiltWith dataset.

We ask how much it would cost to reproduce the package by hiring a programmer and paying them a competitive market wage. To estimate this supply-side value ( 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; ) , we take the complete list of OSS packages discussed above, and then count the lines of code in each unique\n\n14 In an alternative version, we use a mixture of a labor and goods market approach that is more closely aligned with Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff, et al (2021). However, applying this method in our setting requires numerous additional assumptions due to data constraints. For simplicity we call it the goods market approach for which we provide the details and statistics, as well as the limitations in Appendix A.\n\npackage. 15 For each unique package,  , we calculate the value and then sum over all these values i to obtain the total value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nIn this calculation, we implicitly do not incorporate any production externalities since we assume that there is no spillover knowledge from one package to the next that would lower the cost of programming. 16 This methodology is similar to that used by other papers that estimate the supply-side costs of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021).\n\nWe then calculate the demand-side value of OSS by incorporating the usage information ( Q) for each package:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nHere, we do not incorporate consumption externalities, i.e., we do not allow a benefit to arise for the general public when a package has been created and we further make sure that each firm is only replacing a package they use once, since a replaced package can be used within a firm as a club good (e.g., see Cornes and Sandler, 1996). The value 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost to rewrite all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the concept of OSS still exists, but all of these packages needed to be rewritten from scratch), while the value 𝑉 + \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost for each firm that uses one of these OSS packages to pay a developer to rewrite those packages (e.g., OSS itself no longer exists).\n\nFor both the supply and demand models, we obtain the dollar-value for each package ( 𝑃 ( ) via the Constructive Cost Model II, also abbreviated as COCOMO II (Boehm 1984, Boehm et al. 2009). The model has previously been used by the United States Department of Defense to estimate software project costs as well as in prior research estimating the value of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021). It is a highly flexible model that allows us to create non-linear transformations of lines of code to dollar-values. It uses the following modelling equation:\n\n15 We use only the pure lines of code excluding documentation lines and empty lines. Hence, we underestimate the true value of recreating each package.\n\n16 Similar to a representative agent model (e.g. see Williamson 2006), one may think of each package being reproduced by separate programmers who are identical replicas of each other (and therefore have the same skill level, but do not become more efficient via learning).\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n( (\n\nwhere 𝐿 represents the lines of codes in thousands and E the effort in person-month units for each project  . Consistent with Blind et al. (2021), we use the default parameter values for i 𝛼 , 𝛽 and 𝜂. The parameters 𝛼 𝛽 , are non-linear adjustment factors set to 2.94, and 1.0997 respectively . The parameter 𝜂 is an effort-adjustment factor which can be modified to incorporate subjective assessments of product, hardware, personnel, and project attributes. Since we do not have a prior for each project, we set 𝜂 to the default value of one. To obtain the price ( 𝑃 ( ) of each OSS project, we  then  multiply  the  results  of  equation  (3)  by  the  weighted  global  wage  that  an  average programmer would obtain on the open market. To calculate a global wage, we include the base monthly salaries of software developers from Salary Expert for the top 30 countries in terms of their GitHub developer counts in 2021 (Wachs et al., 2022). 17 The weight of each country is its share of active GitHub contributors over the total contributors in the top 30 countries. We further create bounds by using a low-wage (India) and high-wage (USA) labor market for the wage to better understand how the value would vary by the pool of programmers used to recreate all of OSS. 18\n\nDocument 8: ## 3. Methodology\n\nWe first measure the value of OSS by considering the supply and the demand side of OSS using a labor market approach. 14 The thought experiment is that we live in a world where OSS does not exist and has to be recreated at each firm that uses a given piece of OSS. Using the labor market approach, we calculate the labor replacement cost of each OSS package. To estimate the value for each package, we use COCOMO II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) at the individual package level and then sum across all package values to obtain a supply-side labor market replacement value. Then, we scale the supply-side value by the number of times firms are using each package while removing multi-usage within each firm to obtain a demand-side value.\n\nSecond, we move beyond the aggregate and inspect inequality in the value creation process. In OSS, as with many creative endeavors, it is common that a small handful of individuals provide the bulk of the contributions, while many others make small contributions (sometimes referred to as the 80\/20 rule, implying 80% of the work is done by 20% of the people). Research has shown these frequent contributors often attain positions of influence in OSS communities as a result of their efforts (Hanisch, et al, 2018). Therefore, to better understand the dispersion of value creation across developers, we first use the GHTorrent data and identify individual developer contributions in two ways: a) through their OSS value contributions directly and b) through the total number of repositories they contributed to. We then test how concentrated these two contribution measures are to better understand whether many or few developers contribute to the total value we measure. We explain the exact details for the labor market approach and the inequality of valuations below.\n\nDocument 21: ## Appendix A) Goods-Market Valuation Approach\n\nAs an alternate estimation method, instead of using the labor replacement cost, we use a goods replacement value approach. We identify several OSS packages that have similar closed-source, pecuniary alternatives and consider the costs if all commercial users of the free OSS had to replace that software with a pecuniary alternative (similar to the calculations Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) performed for web servers). We can then use this alternate value of p , combined with the q values from above to estimate a goods replacement value of OSS. This method builds on suggestions from Nordhaus (2006, p. 146) who says '…the price of market and nonmarket goods and services should be imputed on the basis of the comparable market goods and services.' We do not expect the estimates from the two methods to be similar. Quite the contrary, the value of those two methods varies substantially since the latter goods-market approach assumes a fixed price to sell a good multiple times and that fixed price is usually lower than the total value estimated from recreating all packages on the labor side. The differential between these estimates is  essentially the result of a firm stepping in to reproduce the missing OSS packages and then selling them for a pecuniary price rather than all firms needing to reproduce those packages from scratch themselves.\n\nWith the goods market approach, the thought experiment is still that we live in a world where OSS does not exist, but it has to be recreated via one firm that then charges a price for a good that is currently free. To value OSS via the goods market approach, we created a basket of equivalent substitute proprietary goods that are priced on the open market as a stand-in for an OSS product.  This  methodology  is  consistent  with  that  used  in  the  prior  literature  (Greenstein  and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021) although both of those studies only used a single good rather than a basket since they were focused on only one type of OSS (web servers). Since there is no readily available database for proprietary equivalents of OSS, we conduct a search based on subjective  perception  of  popularity  of  OSS  and  we  then  search  for  pecuniary,  closed-source substitutes for them. The resulting basket of 20 OSS packages with proprietary substitutes is a good representation of the diversity of OSS. The software ranges from media and design software to statistical analysis programs, to database management and web server software. 21\n\n21 Table A5 shows the basket of OSS and their proprietary equivalents that we used. To create this basket, we looked for proprietary software that had an OSS equivalent that was similar in its overall function and feature set, and sought to identify pairs of software that, in aggregate, captured a broad and representative set of the types of OSS that exist.\n\nBased on our OSS equivalent substitute proprietary goods basket we then obtain prices for each proprietary software equivalent and we calculated the COCOMO labor market supply-side value for each OSS product in the basket which we use as a proxy - for lack of the code from the proprietary software - for the COCOMO labor supply side value of the proprietary software (e.g., the cost it would take to pay a programmer to write that proprietary software from scratch). We then calculate the average COCOMO labor supply-side value of the basket, 𝑉 !,1#23.4 ,  and  the average price for the basket, 𝑃 !,1#23.4 . 22 Since, we know the labor market supply-side value of all OSS, 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; , we can setup the following equation and obtain the price of OSS, 𝑃 ! for the goodsmarket for all OSS via a simple scaling transformation:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nThis results in the following goods-market supply-side value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nWe can then obtain the equivalent demand-side goods-market values as follows:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nFrom the goods market side, we consider the equivalent price that a firm would charge if it produced all existing widely used OSS and then sold it as a product to customers.\n\nTable A6, column 3 shows that the value on the demand side ranges between $177 million and $244 million across the different buckets independent of the country of origin from which programmers are hired. Naturally, the goods-market value will be substantially smaller than the labor demand value since this imaginary firm will make a profit at a comparatively low price by producing the software once and then selling it to many customers. Further, while Greenstein and Nagle (2014) as well as Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) focus on one particular type of software only (web servers), we attempt to expand on their approach to many goods. However, the data limitations become a stronger constraint in this context which makes it inherently more difficult\n\n22 We obtained the average price of the goods-market proprietary basket by using a 3 years lifespan of software, i.e. 1\/(1-0.66), so the depreciation factor is 0.33. This is consistent with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules for depreciating software, which states 'If you can depreciate the cost of computer software, use the straight line method over a useful life of 36 months.' https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/publications\/p946#en\\_US\\_2022\\_publink1000107354.\n\nto  estimate  the  value  through  this  approach  while  requiring  substantially  more  assumptions. Instead of a pure goods-market approach, this requires assistance from the labor-market approach in terms of scaling for the estimate, which ultimately leads to a substantial underestimate of the value of OSS. Further, the pricing strategy of the proprietary software counterparts is sensitive to the  market  demand.  With  the  goods-market  approach  extending  to  multiple  goods,  the  strong implicit assumption is that the market demands for our basket software and our sample OSS are similar, so they lead to commensurate prices.\n\nAn alternative and even more simplified goods-market back-of-the-envelope calculation that does not account for lines of code and relies on no scaling from the labor market approach would simply be to multiply a price of a reference good with the usage. We can take the minimum, average, and maximum prices of the basket of proprietary goods as captured in the reference price vector p = (69.99, 1610.17, 5800) and simply multiply it with usage from the combined Census and BuiltWith sample (Table 1). Based on those imputed proprietary price assumptions, the goods market demand side value would range from $0.2 - $16.5 trillion (minimum price - maximum price)  with  the  mean  price  resulting  in  a  value  estimate  of  $4.5  trillion.  However,  while  this estimate creates slightly more variance than the labor market approach, it is inherently flawed by simply assuming that the imputed prices are identical for each open source product based on the reference price. We further think this very simple back-of-the-envelope is an orange to apples comparison since the goods in our basket are fully functional, stand-alone software packages, while the packages in the Census and BuiltWith datasets are comprised of application libraries, which are generally smaller than such stand-alone packages.\n\nGiven all the complexities and assumptions one has to make due to lack of data for a goodsmarket approach, we place stronger emphasis on the labor cost approach highlighted in the main body but we include this method here for completeness.\n\nDocument 11: ## 4. Results\n\nAfter applying the labor market approach using COCOMO II, we obtain global estimates for the value of OSS.

Conclusion\n\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith. We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average value and distributed it across industries.\n\nIn this study we estimate the value of widely-used open source software globally with two unique datasets: the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data. We are able to estimate not only the supply side value of existing code (e.g., the cost it would take to rewrite each piece of widely-used OSS once) but also the demand side value for the private economy (e.g., the cost it would take for each company that uses a piece of OSS to rewrite it). While we do not focus on the long tail of OSS, we consider this an additional contribution of our study as focusing on OSS that is widely used allows us to more precisely understand the value created by OSS, rather than only measuring the  replacement  cost  for  all  OSS  (which  would  overestimate  the  true  value  since  many  OSS projects are not used in production code). However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n\nAdjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.  We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves.  Over  95%  percent  of  the  demand-side  value  is  generated  by  only  five  percent  of programmers, and those programmers contribute not only to a few widely used projects but to substantially more projects than the programmers that are engaged at the lower end of the value distribution.\n\nIn aggregate, our results show the substantial value that OSS contributes to the economy despite this value generally showing up as zero via direct measurement since prices equal zero and quantity is difficult to measure using public data alone. Our research lays the groundwork for future studies of not only OSS, but of all IT and its growing impact on the global economy.\n\nDocument 14: ## --- Figure 2 about here ---\n\nFigure 2 splits the OSS value estimates for each language by our inward facing (Census) and outward facing (BuiltWith) data sources. Panel A and Panel B focus on the supply and demand side estimation for the Census. We obtain a similar pattern that has been established already in the aggregate when pooling both data sources (Figure 1) albeit the impact of JavaScript is substantially lower.  On  the  supply  side  of  the  Census  in  Panel  A,  Java  has  the  second-highest  value  while JavaScript  code  from  the  Census  contributes  to  a  substantially  lower  value  to  the  aggregate. Similarly, the supply side values of C, Python, and Typescript are mainly driven by the Census. From the demand side Panel B we find that Go is the most popular language for inward facing code while all other languages appear to be negligible in relative terms.\n\nFigure 2, Panel C and Panel D show the supply and demand side values for the BuiltWith dataset. The supply side value in Panel C clearly indicates that the value from the BuiltWith sample is driven by JavaScript code, which is a good sanity check since we focused on JavaScript packages to proxy for OSS in the BuiltWith sample, as discussed above. The second highest value is created by TypeScript which is reassuring since it is a superset of JavaScript. Panel D shows a similar pattern  on  the  usage  side  where  most  of  the  value  arises  from  JavaScript  while  TypeScript  is trailing at the second spot as well. The other languages contribute only marginal amounts to the supply and demand side values. Overall, these findings are broadly consistent with the main use cases of the various languages (web programming vs. application programming) and an idea that languages through which value are generated are not necessarily identical to languages that are used by the general public.\n\n--- Figure 3 about here ---\n\nFigure 3 shows the demand-side value of OSS across industries by NAICS 2-digit codes using the BuiltWith online data. 20 This can be interpreted as the value each of these industries receive because OSS exists. The industry with the highest usage value of around $43 billion is 'Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.' 'Retail Trade' as well as 'Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services' make up another large part of the demand-side externally facing value of OSS with $36 billion and $35 billion, respectively. In contrast, industries that constitute just a small portion of the value are 'Mining, Quarrying, and Oil  and  Gas  Extraction',  'Utilities',  'Agriculture,  Forestry,  Fishing,  and  Hunting.'  The  latter industries are classical non-service sector industries and as such software is expected to play less of a role there.\n\nDocument 12: ## --- Table 1 about here ---\n\nTable  1  shows  descriptive  statistics  from  both  data  sets  separately.  The  inward-facing Census  (Panel  A)  contains  just  over  261.7  million  lines  of  code  with  72%  of  the  lines  being attributable to the top programming languages. The average package includes 142 thousand lines of code with a slightly lower average of 113 thousand lines of code for the subset of top languages. When considering the demand (usage) side, we observe that the Census packages were used over 2.7 million times while 92% of this usage is attributable to the top languages. The average package was used 1,472.4 times with a higher usage of around 1,497.5 for the top  languages.  For  the outward-facing  BuiltWith  data  we  find  similar  patterns,  but  at  different  levels.  The  packages included from BuiltWith include over 82 million lines of code, 71% of which are attributable to the  top  programming  languages.  The  average  package  within  the  BuiltWith  sample  has  111 thousand  lines  of  code  with  a  lower  average  of  around  80  thousand  lines  of  code  for  the  top languages. This is because our BuiltWith data primarily consists of JavaScript-based packages, which are often smaller than packages written in other languages. BuiltWith packages were used over 142 thousand times where 99.97% were attributable to the top languages. Next, we used these raw observations to calculate the value of all OSS through the labor market approach and estimated the value created from the supply and demand side.\n\n--- Table 2 about here ---\n\nTable 2 shows the estimates for the value of OSS based on the firm-relevant joint Census and BuiltWith sample. All estimates in Table 2 are based only on software languages classified in bucket  1  from  Table  A1,  which  are  the  most  likely  to  be  written  by  a  human  rather  than  a machine. 19 The first column contains estimates with wages from a low income country (India), the global  average  wage,  and  a  high  income  country  (United  States  of  America),  respectively  (as described above). To reproduce all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the idea of OSS still exists, but all current OSS is deleted and needs to be coded from scratch), using programmers at the average developer wage from India, it would require an investment of $1.22 billion. In contrast, if we use the average developer wage from the United States, then reproducing all widely-used OSS would require  an  investment  of  $6.22  billion.  Using  a  pool  of  programmers  from  across  the  world, weighed based on the existing geographic contributions to OSS as discussed above, would lead to an investment somewhere in between the low and high-income country, $4.15 billion. It is useful to compare these numbers to those from similar studies to understand differences in valuing all OSS (prior studies) versus that which is widely used (our study). Robbins et al. (2021) and Blind et al. (2021) use a method similar to ours and estimate that the value of OSS created in the US is $38 billion in 2019 and that created in the EU is €1 billion in 2018. Wachs et al. (2022) show that roughly 50% of OSS contributions come from the US and EU combined. In aggregate, that would lead these studies to give a global value of OSS of $78 billion. Thus, our middle estimate of a supply-side value of $4.15 billion for only firm-oriented and widely used OSS is a credible lowerbound and highlights the higher estimations of the total of supply-side value of OSS when not considering whether or not a given OSS package is widely used. This further indicates that the supply-side value of the most widely used OSS is roughly 5.5% of the supply-side value of all OSS.\n\nThe second column in Table 2 contains the demand side estimates based on the labor market approach. We find that if firms had to recreate all OSS packages they used (e.g., OSS itself no longer existed and every firm that used an OSS package had to recreate it), then the entire cost would amount to between $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion using labor from the low wage or high wage country only, respectively. A pool of programmers across the globe could recreate all of OSS that is being widely used for a cost of approximately $8.80 trillion. Interpreting this number is\n\n19 Tables in the appendix show the equivalent values from Table 2 when including software language buckets 1 and 2 (Table A3) and all three software language buckets (Table A4).\n\nslightly more complicated but still feasible. According to a Statista (2023) report, global software revenue in 2020 (the same year as our data) was $531.7 billion. However, this represents a flow, not a stock, of software. Relying on government estimates that software fully depreciates over three years, we can do a back of the envelope calculation and consider the purchase value of the full stock of prepackaged software used in 2020 as the aggregate of that sold from 2018 to 2020, which is $1.54 trillion. Further, this represents only the expenditure on prepackaged software and does  not  include  custom  purchased  or  in-house  developed  software.  Here,  the  best  obtainable estimates of private-sector investment in software overall come from the United States National Income and Product Accounts data (NIPA 2023). In 2020, the national account data shows that in the  US,  private  firms  spent  $479.2  billion  on  software,  of  which  45%  ($215.5  billion)  was prepackaged. If we assume this is a consistent ratio for the rest of the world, then the total amount firms spent on software being used in 2020 was $3.4 trillion (= $1.54 trillion\/0.45). Combining this rough estimate with the demand side estimate of the value of OSS based on an average global wage ($8.8 trillion), this indicates firms would spend $12.2 trillion (=$3.4 trillion + $8.8 trillion), or three and a half times what they currently spend if they needed to pay in-house developers to write the OSS that they currently use for free.\n\nDocument 6: ## 1. Introduction\n\nIn 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that 'software is eating the world' (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that 'open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,' (Jacks, 2022). Other recent studies have come to similar conclusions showing that open source software  (OSS)  -  software  whose  source  code  is  publicly  available  for  inspection,  use,  and modification and is often created in a decentralized manner and distributed for free - appears in 96% of codebases (Synopsys 2023), and that some commercial software consists of up to 99.9% freely available OSS (Musseau et al., 2022). Although in its early days OSS frequently copied features from existing proprietary software, OSS today includes cutting edge technology in various fields including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, big data, and analytics.  However, despite the increasing importance of OSS to all software (and therefore to the entire economy), measuring its impact has been elusive. Traditionally, to measure the value created by a good or service,  economists  multiply  the  price  ( p )  times  the  quantity  sold  ( q ).  However,  in  OSS, p is generally zero since the source code is publicly available, and q is  unknown due to the limited number of restrictions around how the code may be copied and reused. For example, if a company downloads  a  piece  of  OSS  from  a  public  code  repository,  it  may  copy  it  thousands  of  times internally (legally) and then share it with suppliers or customers (also legally), so public download data is insufficient. Although some recent studies have sought to estimate the value of p (discussed below), data for estimating q has been unavailable or intractable for anything more than just a handful of OSS packages. Using newly collected data from multiple sources, the goal of this paper is to provide estimates for both p and q and to use those to shine light on the question: What is the value of open source software?\n\nUnderstanding the value of OSS is of critical importance not only due to the role it plays in the economy, but also due to it being one of the most successful and impactful modern examples of the centuries old economic concept of 'the commons' which run the risk of meeting the fate known as 'the tragedy of the commons.' This concept can trace its roots as far back as the 4 th -century BC philosopher Aristotle who wrote 'That which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care. Men pay most attention to what is their own and care less for what is common.'  (Aristotle,  1981).  William  Forster  Lloyd  (1833)  resurfaced  the  idea  in  modern economic thought by highlighting the example of shared tracts of land used for cattle grazing by\n\nmultiple cattle herders who each had an incentive to overuse the shared resource. Garrett Hardin (1968)  brought  the  concept  into  the  broader  zeitgeist  when  he  wrote  an  article  discussing  the problem entitled 'The Tragedy of the Commons.' Building on this work, Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for her research highlighting paths to avoiding the tragedy of the commons through community coordination efforts that did not necessitate government enforced laws to manage and guard the commons (Ostrom 1990). The parallels between shared grazing lands and shared digital infrastructure are palpable - the availability of communal grass to feed cattle, and in turn feed people, was critical to the agrarian economy, and the ability to not have to recreate code that someone else has already written is critical to the modern economy. Further, in both contexts, despite knowing grass and code are critical inputs to the economy, measuring their actual value is difficult. And, as the renowned mathematician and physicist Lord Kelvin is believed to have said, 'If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.' And if you cannot improve and maintain it, such common goods may crumble under the weight of their own success as they are overused, but underinvested in (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021). Therefore, measuring the value OSS creates is crucial to the future health of the digital economy, and the rest of the economy that is built on top of it.\n\nImportantly, recent studies have attempted to address these measurement issues but fall short of capturing both the breadth and depth of OSS usage - a gap we seek to fill with this paper. For example, researchers have attempted to gain breadth by using novel methodologies to estimate the labor replacement value of the current corpus of OSS created in the United States at $38 billion in 2019 (Robbins et al., 2021) and that created in the European Union at €1 billion (Blind et al., 2021) by imputing the labor costs that it would have taken to rewrite existing OSS. Such efforts do a very good job at estimating what it would cost to replace all existing OSS if it disappeared tomorrow. However, the resultant estimates rely on two important assumptions. First, that all OSS is equally valuable from a usage standpoint, and second that the concept of OSS would still exist, and society would just need to rewrite the code once, thus addressing the aforementioned problem of a missing value for p , but not addressing the missing value of q . In a world where OSS did not exist at all, then each piece of OSS software would not need to be rewritten just once, but instead would need to be rewritten by every firm that used the software (assuming the firm could freely share the software within its boundaries). Other research (Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; MurcianoGoroff, Zhuo, and Greenstein, 2021) has gone deeper into this hypothetical, albeit in a narrow\n\nmanner, by only focusing on web servers (which are public facing on the Internet and can therefore be readily measured). Using different methods, both studies measure q for this one type of software and impute p by using a goods replacement value approach based on the prices for closed-source alternatives offered by firms. With data from the United States the resulting estimates show a value of  $2  billion  for  the  OSS  Apache  Web  Server  in  2012  (Greenstein  and  Nagle,  2014)  and  a combined value of $4.5 billion for Apache and the increasingly popular OSS web server nginx in 2018 (Murciano-Goroff, et al., 2021). However, although web servers are an important part of the OSS  ecosystem,  they  constitute  a  small  portion  of  it.  We  seek  to  build  upon  the  important contributions this existing research has made in an attempt to go both broad and deep to create a more complete measure of the value of OSS.\n\nTo consider the value of OSS in both a broad and deep manner, we use data from two primary sources that allow us to gain insights into the OSS used at tens of thousands of firms across the world. The first is the 'Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries' (Nagle et al., 2022). The Census II project utilized partnerships with multiple software composition analysis (SCA) firms to create various lists of the most widely used OSS. SCAs are hired to scan the codebases of a company to ensure they are not violating any OSS licenses and, as a byproduct, track all the OSS code used by their customers and the products they build. The Census II project aggregated data from multiple SCAs to build a dataset of OSS usage at tens of thousands of firms based  on  millions  of  data  points  (observations  of  OSS  usage).  The  second  data  source  is  the BuiltWith dataset, from which we leverage scans of nearly nine million websites to identify the underlying technology deployed by these websites, including OSS libraries. The BuiltWith data has been used in multiple academic studies (DeStefano &amp; Timmis 2023, Dushnitsky &amp; Stroube 2021, Koning et al.. 2022), but to our knowledge this is the first one to focus on OSS usage. The Census II data and the BuiltWith data are complementary as the former focuses on OSS that is built  into  the  software  a  company  sells,  while  the  latter  focuses  on  OSS  that  is  built  into  a company's website, thus reducing the chances of double-counting observations across the datasets. In aggregate, these two datasets combined create the most complete measurement of OSS usage ( q ) to date. Further, by focusing on OSS that is widely deployed and used by firms, rather than considering all the projects that exist in an OSS repository, we enhance the methodologies of prior studies by reducing the likelihood of measurement error stemming from projects that are posted as publicly available OSS but are not actually used in any practical manner. Not accounting for this\n\nmeasurement error would lead to overestimation of the actual value of OSS as projects that are widely used would be valued in the same way as projects that are not used at all.\n\nTo estimate p ,  we  follow  the  literature  discussed  above  and  use  the  labor  replacement value. First, we calculate the labor cost it would take an individual firm to recreate a given OSS package by measuring the number of lines of code within the package and then applying the Constructive Cost Model II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) - also known as COCOMO II to estimate the number of person-hours it would take to write the code from scratch. We then utilize global wage data from Salary Expert to get an accurate estimate of the labor costs a firm would incur if this piece of OSS did not exist. These costs can be combined with the q values from above at the OSS package level to estimate the combined value of all OSS from both the supply and demand sides.\n\nWe find a value ranging from $1.22 billion to $6.22 billion if we were to decide as a society to recreate all widely used OSS on the supply side. However, considering the actual usage of OSS leads to a demand-side value that is orders of magnitude larger and ranges from $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion, if each firm who used an OSS package had to recreate it from scratch (e.g., the concept of OSS did not exist). We document substantial heterogeneity of the value of OSS by programming  language  and  internal  vs  outward-facing  programming  efforts.  Further,  we  find considerable  heterogeneity  in  value  contributions  by  programmers  as  5%  of  programmers  are responsible for more than 90% of the value created on the supply- and demand- side. The data we use is arguably the most comprehensive source of data to measure the value created by firm usage of OSS at this time. However, as for any project, the evidence is not complete and we argue that we underestimate the value since our data, e.g., does not include operating systems, which are a substantial omitted category of OSS.\n\nThis study makes four important contributions to the academic literature, practitioners, and policy makers. First, it provides the most complete estimate of the value of widely used OSS to date  by  accounting  for  not  only  the  supply-side  of  OSS  (price  to  create  it),  but  also  for  the usage\/demand-side at a scale that has not been done before. While prior estimates of the value of OSS only went either broad (estimating the supply-side costs of a large swath of OSS) or deep (estimating the value created by one particular type of OSS), this study does both by using unique datasets that allow for a better understanding of the breadth and depth of OSS usage. Further, rather than measuring the value of all OSS, this study focuses on the value of OSS that is used by firms\n\nto create its products and websites, limiting the measurement error occurring in studies that are unable to account for which OSS is actually used in production. This contribution builds upon, and extends, important research (e.g., Blind et al., 2021; Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021; Robbins et al., 2021) that has sought to identify the value of this vital resource that contributes a great deal to the modern economy despite the difficulties measuring this contribution. In  doing  so,  it  adds  insights  to  a  long-running  discussion  related  to  the  impact  of  information technology (IT) on productivity (Brynjolfsson, 1993; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 1996; Nagle, 2019a; Solow, 1987) known as the 'productivity paradox' where IT investments can have limited impact on productivity statistics. This debate has continued into the emerging context of AI (Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson, 2018). Our work contributes to this conversation by highlighting a massive societal level cost-savings (and hence productivity enhancement) that is created by the existence of OSS.\n\nSecond, our research contributes methodological advances to the study of intangible capital by highlighting novel sources of data related to investments in OSS. Prior research has shown that intangible capital plays an increasingly important role in economic growth (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel,  2009)  and  firm  value  (Peters  and  Taylor,  2017),  but  it  often  goes  unmeasured  or misattributed (Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou, 2014). Further, we demonstrate how these data sources can be used to understand the true investments in software that a firm makes, and that which they would have to make if OSS did not exist.  This  is  valuable  as  investments  in  software  are  an increasingly important type of intangible capital that is driving innovation (Branstetter, Drev, and Kwon, 2019) and performance (Krishnan et al., 2000).\n\nThird, our results help highlight for firms and managers the importance of OSS to their production, and ideally add weight to arguments that users of OSS should not just free ride but also contribute to the creation and maintenance of OSS (e.g., Henkel, 2008; Nagle, 2018). Such contributions are a fraction of the costs that firms would incur if OSS did not exist and the active participation of OSS users in helping maintain the OSS they use is critical to the health and future well-being of the OSS ecosystem (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021; Zhang et al., 2019).\n\nFourth,  and  finally,  our  study  helps  inform  policymakers  who  have  recently  started  to understand  the  growing  importance  of  OSS  to  the  economy  and  taken  actions  to  support  the ecosystem (European Commission, 2020; Executive Order No. 14028, 2021). However, most of these efforts are related to securing the existing OSS ecosystem, which is quite important, but do\n\nnot go as far as supporting the creation of new OSS. Our results help shine light on the importance of OSS to the overall economy and add weight to calls for more societal support of this critical resource. Our results further show that the majority of the value created by OSS is created by a small  number  of  contributors.  Although  it  has  long  been  known  that  a  small  number  of  OSS contributors do most of the work, we add new insights that show this is even more true for the value creation of widely-used OSS projects and that societal support for these individuals is critical to the future success of OSS, and in turn, the economy.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the empirical setting and data. Section 3 discusses the methods including measurement challenges. In section 4, we estimate the value of open source software.

Results\n\nAfter applying the labor market approach using COCOMO II, we obtain global estimates for the value of OSS. To calculate the overall value, we first need the underlying number of lines of code (to calculate the supply-side value) and then the usage statistics (for the demand-side value). Since there may be substantial heterogeneity in value by programming languages, we also show the top programming languages during our investigation period in the year 2020, as discussed above.\n\nDocument 9: ## 3.1 Labor market approach\n\nFor the labor market approach, we estimate the value of OSS by calculating the replacement value of a package. We ask how much it would cost to reproduce the package by hiring a programmer and paying them a competitive market wage. To estimate this supply-side value ( 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; ) , we take the complete list of OSS packages discussed above, and then count the lines of code in each unique\n\n14 In an alternative version, we use a mixture of a labor and goods market approach that is more closely aligned with Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff, et al (2021). However, applying this method in our setting requires numerous additional assumptions due to data constraints. For simplicity we call it the goods market approach for which we provide the details and statistics, as well as the limitations in Appendix A.\n\npackage. 15 For each unique package,  , we calculate the value and then sum over all these values i to obtain the total value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nIn this calculation, we implicitly do not incorporate any production externalities since we assume that there is no spillover knowledge from one package to the next that would lower the cost of programming. 16 This methodology is similar to that used by other papers that estimate the supply-side costs of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021).\n\nWe then calculate the demand-side value of OSS by incorporating the usage information ( Q) for each package:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nHere, we do not incorporate consumption externalities, i.e., we do not allow a benefit to arise for the general public when a package has been created and we further make sure that each firm is only replacing a package they use once, since a replaced package can be used within a firm as a club good (e.g., see Cornes and Sandler, 1996). The value 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost to rewrite all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the concept of OSS still exists, but all of these packages needed to be rewritten from scratch), while the value 𝑉 + \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost for each firm that uses one of these OSS packages to pay a developer to rewrite those packages (e.g., OSS itself no longer exists).\n\nFor both the supply and demand models, we obtain the dollar-value for each package ( 𝑃 ( ) via the Constructive Cost Model II, also abbreviated as COCOMO II (Boehm 1984, Boehm et al. 2009). The model has previously been used by the United States Department of Defense to estimate software project costs as well as in prior research estimating the value of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021). It is a highly flexible model that allows us to create non-linear transformations of lines of code to dollar-values. It uses the following modelling equation:\n\n15 We use only the pure lines of code excluding documentation lines and empty lines. Hence, we underestimate the true value of recreating each package.\n\n16 Similar to a representative agent model (e.g. see Williamson 2006), one may think of each package being reproduced by separate programmers who are identical replicas of each other (and therefore have the same skill level, but do not become more efficient via learning).\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n( (\n\nwhere 𝐿 represents the lines of codes in thousands and E the effort in person-month units for each project  . Consistent with Blind et al. (2021), we use the default parameter values for i 𝛼 , 𝛽 and 𝜂. The parameters 𝛼 𝛽 , are non-linear adjustment factors set to 2.94, and 1.0997 respectively . The parameter 𝜂 is an effort-adjustment factor which can be modified to incorporate subjective assessments of product, hardware, personnel, and project attributes. Since we do not have a prior for each project, we set 𝜂 to the default value of one. To obtain the price ( 𝑃 ( ) of each OSS project, we  then  multiply  the  results  of  equation  (3)  by  the  weighted  global  wage  that  an  average programmer would obtain on the open market. To calculate a global wage, we include the base monthly salaries of software developers from Salary Expert for the top 30 countries in terms of their GitHub developer counts in 2021 (Wachs et al., 2022). 17 The weight of each country is its share of active GitHub contributors over the total contributors in the top 30 countries. We further create bounds by using a low-wage (India) and high-wage (USA) labor market for the wage to better understand how the value would vary by the pool of programmers used to recreate all of OSS. 18\n\nDocument 8: ## 3. Methodology\n\nWe first measure the value of OSS by considering the supply and the demand side of OSS using a labor market approach. 14 The thought experiment is that we live in a world where OSS does not exist and has to be recreated at each firm that uses a given piece of OSS. Using the labor market approach, we calculate the labor replacement cost of each OSS package. To estimate the value for each package, we use COCOMO II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) at the individual package level and then sum across all package values to obtain a supply-side labor market replacement value. Then, we scale the supply-side value by the number of times firms are using each package while removing multi-usage within each firm to obtain a demand-side value.\n\nSecond, we move beyond the aggregate and inspect inequality in the value creation process. In OSS, as with many creative endeavors, it is common that a small handful of individuals provide the bulk of the contributions, while many others make small contributions (sometimes referred to as the 80\/20 rule, implying 80% of the work is done by 20% of the people). Research has shown these frequent contributors often attain positions of influence in OSS communities as a result of their efforts (Hanisch, et al, 2018). Therefore, to better understand the dispersion of value creation across developers, we first use the GHTorrent data and identify individual developer contributions in two ways: a) through their OSS value contributions directly and b) through the total number of repositories they contributed to. We then test how concentrated these two contribution measures are to better understand whether many or few developers contribute to the total value we measure. We explain the exact details for the labor market approach and the inequality of valuations below.","conversation_history":[{"role":"user","content":"I am interested in the method used to estimate the supply-side value of OSS in the Harvard Business School's report."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How can I help you with that?"}],"metadata":{"question_type":"conversational","seed_document_id":11,"topic":"Others"}}

Introduction\n\nIn 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that 'software is eating the world' (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that 'open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,' (Jacks, 2022). Other recent studies have come to similar conclusions showing that open source software  (OSS)  -  software  whose  source  code  is  publicly  available  for  inspection,  use,  and modification and is often created in a decentralized manner and distributed for free - appears in 96% of codebases (Synopsys 2023), and that some commercial software consists of up to 99.9% freely available OSS (Musseau et al., 2022). Although in its early days OSS frequently copied features from existing proprietary software, OSS today includes cutting edge technology in various fields including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, big data, and analytics.  However, despite the increasing importance of OSS to all software (and therefore to the entire economy), measuring its impact has been elusive. Traditionally, to measure the value created by a good or service,  economists  multiply  the  price  ( p )  times  the  quantity  sold  ( q ).  However,  in  OSS, p is generally zero since the source code is publicly available, and q is  unknown due to the limited number of restrictions around how the code may be copied and reused.

Further, rather than measuring the value of all OSS, this study focuses on the value of OSS that is used by firms\n\nto create its products and websites, limiting the measurement error occurring in studies that are unable to account for which OSS is actually used in production. This contribution builds upon, and extends, important research (e.g., Blind et al., 2021; Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021; Robbins et al., 2021) that has sought to identify the value of this vital resource that contributes a great deal to the modern economy despite the difficulties measuring this contribution. In  doing  so,  it  adds  insights  to  a  long-running  discussion  related  to  the  impact  of  information technology (IT) on productivity (Brynjolfsson, 1993; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 1996; Nagle, 2019a; Solow, 1987) known as the 'productivity paradox' where IT investments can have limited impact on productivity statistics. This debate has continued into the emerging context of AI (Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson, 2018). Our work contributes to this conversation by highlighting a massive societal level cost-savings (and hence productivity enhancement) that is created by the existence of OSS.\n\nSecond, our research contributes methodological advances to the study of intangible capital by highlighting novel sources of data related to investments in OSS. Prior research has shown that intangible capital plays an increasingly important role in economic growth (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel,  2009)  and  firm  value  (Peters  and  Taylor,  2017),  but  it  often  goes  unmeasured  or misattributed (Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou, 2014). Further, we demonstrate how these data sources can be used to understand the true investments in software that a firm makes, and that which they would have to make if OSS did not exist.  This  is  valuable  as  investments  in  software  are  an increasingly important type of intangible capital that is driving innovation (Branstetter, Drev, and Kwon, 2019) and performance (Krishnan et al., 2000).\n\nThird, our results help highlight for firms and managers the importance of OSS to their production, and ideally add weight to arguments that users of OSS should not just free ride but also contribute to the creation and maintenance of OSS (e.g., Henkel, 2008; Nagle, 2018). Such contributions are a fraction of the costs that firms would incur if OSS did not exist and the active participation of OSS users in helping maintain the OSS they use is critical to the health and future well-being of the OSS ecosystem (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021; Zhang et al., 2019).\n\nFourth,  and  finally,  our  study  helps  inform  policymakers  who  have  recently  started  to understand  the  growing  importance  of  OSS  to  the  economy  and  taken  actions  to  support  the ecosystem (European Commission, 2020; Executive Order No. 14028, 2021). However, most of these efforts are related to securing the existing OSS ecosystem, which is quite important, but do\n\nnot go as far as supporting the creation of new OSS. Our results help shine light on the importance of OSS to the overall economy and add weight to calls for more societal support of this critical resource. Our results further show that the majority of the value created by OSS is created by a small  number  of  contributors.  Although  it  has  long  been  known  that  a  small  number  of  OSS contributors do most of the work, we add new insights that show this is even more true for the value creation of widely-used OSS projects and that societal support for these individuals is critical to the future success of OSS, and in turn, the economy.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the empirical setting and data. Section 3 discusses the methods including measurement challenges. In section 4, we estimate the value of open source software. Section 5 concludes.\n\nDocument 16: ## 5. Conclusion\n\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith. We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average value and distributed it across industries.\n\nIn this study we estimate the value of widely-used open source software globally with two unique datasets: the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data. We are able to estimate not only the supply side value of existing code (e.g., the cost it would take to rewrite each piece of widely-used OSS once) but also the demand side value for the private economy (e.g., the cost it would take for each company that uses a piece of OSS to rewrite it). While we do not focus on the long tail of OSS, we consider this an additional contribution of our study as focusing on OSS that is widely used allows us to more precisely understand the value created by OSS, rather than only measuring the  replacement  cost  for  all  OSS  (which  would  overestimate  the  true  value  since  many  OSS projects are not used in production code). However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n\nAdjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.  We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves.  Over  95%  percent  of  the  demand-side  value  is  generated  by  only  five  percent  of programmers, and those programmers contribute not only to a few widely used projects but to substantially more projects than the programmers that are engaged at the lower end of the value distribution.\n\nIn aggregate, our results show the substantial value that OSS contributes to the economy despite this value generally showing up as zero via direct measurement since prices equal zero and quantity is difficult to measure using public data alone. Our research lays the groundwork for future studies of not only OSS, but of all IT and its growing impact on the global economy.\n\nDocument 5: ## Abstract\n\nThe  value  of  a  non-pecuniary  (free)  product  is  inherently  difficult  to  assess.  A  pervasive example is open source software (OSS), a global public good that plays a vital role in the economy and is foundational for most technology we use today. However, it is difficult to measure the value of OSS due to its non-pecuniary nature and lack of centralized usage tracking. Therefore, OSS remains largely unaccounted for in economic measures. Although prior studies have estimated the supply-side costs to recreate this software, a lack of data has hampered estimating the much larger demand-side (usage) value created by OSS. Therefore, to understand the complete economic and social value of widely-used OSS, we leverage unique global data from two complementary sources capturing  OSS  usage  by  millions  of  global  firms.  We  first  estimate  the  supply-side  value  by calculating the cost to recreate the most widely used OSS once. We then calculate the demandside value based on a replacement value for each firm that uses the software and would need to build it internally if OSS did not exist. We estimate the supply-side value of widely-used OSS is $4.15 billion, but that the demand-side value is much larger at $8.8 trillion. We find that firms would need to spend 3.5 times more on software than they currently do if OSS did not exist. The top six programming languages in our sample comprise 84% of the demand-side value of OSS. Further, 96% of the demand-side value is created by only 5% of OSS developers.\n\nJEL Classification:\n\nH4; O3; J0\n\nKeywords: Open-source software, global public good\n\nAcknowledgement: The authors are grateful for  financial  and  administrative  support  from  the Linux  Foundation  without  which  the  data  from  the  Census  would  not  have  otherwise  been available.

Empirical Setting and Data\n\nAlthough the concept of free and open software has existed since the 1950's, it became more popular in the 1980's due to the efforts of Richard Stallman and his launch of the GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation (Maracke, 2019). However, it was in the 1990's that OSS took off after Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel, a now widely adopted OSS operating system (Tozzi, 2016). Today, OSS is considered a key building block of the digital economy and is widely used by software developers in everything from phones to cars to refrigerators to cutting-edge AI (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021).\n\nWe use two complementary main data sources to estimate the value of OSS. The first is the Census and is inward facing. It allows us to identify OSS code that goes into products that firms create. The second dataset is BuiltWith and is outward facing, allowing us to identify OSS code  that  consumers  directly  interact  with  through  firm  websites.  Since  the  raw  data  in  both datasets only contains package names, version numbers, and package manager names, and does not  contain  any  source  code  related  information,  we  first  obtain  the  publicly  accessible  code repository for each package which includes package-level information including the lines of code and  the  programming  languages  used.  One  may  worry  about  double-counting  for  the  value calculations as a result of using two separate datasets. However, the overlap of both the Census and  the  BuiltWith  sample  is  very  small:  there  are  only  18  packages  found  in  both  datasets. Moreover, it is unlikely that double counting is a concern as the two datasets capture different dimensions of OSS usage: the Census captures packaged software whose usage is inward-facing while BuiltWith captures usage in websites that are outward-facing. Finally, as a supplementary\n\ndataset, we use GHTorrent, a detailed history of OSS-related activity on GitHub, the most popular OSS hosting platform and a commonly used data source for studies of OSS (e.g., Burton et al, 2017; Conti, Peukert, and Roche, 2023; Fackler, Hofmann, and Laurentsyeva, 2023; Kim, 2020; Tang, Wang, &amp; Tong, 2023). This detailed historical data allows us to go deeper into how the value  of  OSS  is  created  by  better  understanding  the  dispersion  of  the  contributions  across individual OSS developers. We describe the details of all three data sources and their preparation for estimation below.\n\nCensus. The  Census  II  of  Free  and  Open  Source  Software  (here:  Census)  was  jointly undertaken by the Linux Foundation and the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (Nagle et  al.,  2022). 1 The  Census  was  created  via  the  aggregation  of  data  from  three  major  software composition analysis (SCA) firms with thousands of clients across the globe. SCAs are hired to scan the codebase of a client and gather the OSS usage embedded in their proprietary software to ensure they are not violating any OSS license agreements.  Frequently this takes place as part of 2 the due diligence process related to mergers and acquisitions. Unlike other OSS demand measures available from public sources such as package download counts and code changes, the way this data was collected ensures that we observe the precise amount and type of internal OSS usage of the firms. In addition, it allows us to trace the dependencies each package relies on, so that we can observe the indirect OSS usage that is commonly hidden and difficult to obtain.  The result is over 3 2.7 million observations of OSS packages being used within products created by the SCA client firms for the calendar year 2020 (January 1 to December 31, 2020). 4\n\nThe Census project standardized package names based on the naming system of libraries.io -  a  widely  used  site  maintained  by  Tidelift  that  organizes  information  about  more  than  eight million open source packages. The Census focused on the top 2,000 packages based on usage\n\n1 The precise methodologies for the data collection and aggregation are detailed in the Census report by Nagle et al (2022).\n\n2 OSS usage licenses vary a great deal and while some licenses are very open and allow the code to be reused in any manner, including within proprietary code that will be made available for sale at a non-zero price, other licenses restrict reuse to only be allowed if the resultant code is released under the same OSS license (known as copyleft). A detailed discussion of OSS licenses can be found in Lerner and Tirole (2005) and Almeida et al (2017).\n\n3 Indirect OSS usage is captured by dependency analysis and is necessary to accurately measure the full breadth of the OSS a firm relies on. For example, if a firm's proprietary code calls OSS package A, but package A, in turn, calls package B, then only looking at the direct calls would miss that package B was a required building block for the firm's proprietary code.\n\n4 The Census defines an OSS package as 'a unit of software that can be installed and managed by a package manager,' and  defines  a  package  manager  as  'software  that  automates  the  process  of  installing  and  otherwise  managing packages' (Nagle et al, 2022).\n\nreported from the three of the most prominent SCA vendors to identify the most widely used OSS rather  than  the  long-tail  of  the  usage  distribution.  This  led  to  packages  with  less  than  five observations  of  usage  being  dropped.  Since  packages  written  in  the  JavaScript  programming language, and usually hosted on the Node Package Manager (NPM), are generally smaller (fewer lines  of  code)  than  packages  in  other  languages  and  therefore  frequently  have  higher  usage numbers (since developers must include many small packages instead of a few large packages), the Census separately selected the top 1,000 NPM packages and the top 1,000 non-NPM hosted packages.\n\nThis final dataset covers 70% of the total usage of OSS observed in the raw data of the census.   For  each  of  these  2,000  OSS  packages  in  the  Census,  we  identified  the  raw  code 5 maintained on GitHub, the most widely used platform for hosting OSS.  We first attempted to 6 obtain the GitHub repository uniform resource locator (URL) for each package from libraries.io. We were able to match 1,657 packages to repositories via this initial method.  For URLs without 7 a  matching  repository,  we  performed  Google  searches  loosely  following  the  method  in  Singh (2020). More specifically, for each unmatched package, we used the Google API to search for the package name and 'GitHub Repository' and treated the first GitHub repository URL in the results as  its  best  matched  GitHub  URL.   This  resulted  in  an  additional  174  packages  matched  to  a 8 repository. Finally, we manually searched for URLs for the remaining 169 packages to identify the relevant repository. This entire process resulted in matching 1,840 out of the 2,000 Census packages to a code repository with the raw source code for the package. The unmatched packages were determined to have been either removed from GitHub or became proprietary (and thus the original source code was no longer available) and hence, the manual search allowed us to drop\n\n5 The packages that made up the remaining 30% of the full Census data in the long-tail usage distribution were not shared in the final report and therefore cannot be included in our analysis.\n\n6 GitHub  is  a  hosting  and  collaboration  platform  that  contributors  can  use  to  coordinate  the  development  and distribution of OSS projects. Founded in 2008, GitHub has become the largest hub for OSS development in the world. In January 2023, GitHub had more than 370 million repositories and over 100 million developers. In addition to personal users, a wide range of private firms actively use the GitHub platform, including Microsoft (which bought GitHub in 2018), Facebook, Google, and numerous other small and large firms.\n\n7 We attempted to access all repository URLs obtained as a sanity check to ensure they are in working condition. For those we could not access on GitHub, we manually found the correct URLs.\n\n8 As a robustness check, we randomly selected 50 package-repository matches derived from the Google Search method and we checked them by hand. All matches were manually confirmed to be correct providing additional support for the automated matching method.\n\nthese 160 unmatched packages (less than 8% of the Census sample of 2,000) with high confidence from our analysis.\n\nBuiltWith. The BuiltWith data contains scans of all public websites across the globe and identifies the technologies they use. Unlike the inward facing Census data which focus on the usage of OSS, the BuiltWith data scan for the use of both proprietary and OSS in firm websites without explicit differentiation. To separate OSS from proprietary software in BuiltWith, we turn to the subset of all open source web development software in the technology category that includes \"JavaScript and its libraries,\" which generates 778 observations corresponding to the NPM OSS category  in  the  Census  data.  There  are  two  reasons  for  this  sampling  choice.  First,  this  given category is constructed by BuiltWith and we use it as a proxy for OSS to separate it from pecuniary software.  Second,  JavaScript,  one  of  the  core  technologies  for  building  websites,  is  the  most popular programming language by usage on GitHub (GitHub, 2022) and thus enables us to capture the most important OSS from the demand side perspective. The scans include 8.8 million unique websites and 72.8 million corresponding observations of OSS usage from January 1 to November 16, 2020. Further, to ensure that we measure the value of OSS usage generated by the private sector,  we  match  the  adopting  domains  of  the  JavaScript-related  OSS  from  BuiltWith  with company websites recorded in Orbis, Compustat, and PitchBook, three commonly used databases of corporate activity that capture registered businesses across the world. Performing this match ensures that OSS used by non-commercial websites (e.g., an individual person's personal website) is excluded in our analysis. This results in a match-rate of 38.6%, which corresponds to around 3.4 million websites of distinct firms.\n\nFor the BuiltWith data, we cannot employ the first method we use for the Census (using libraries.io to help identify the repository URL) since only the technology names associated with the  packages  were  provided  by  BuiltWith,  and  other  information  (e.g.,  package  and  package manager  names)  is  not  included. 9 Hence,  we  start  by  performing  the  Google  Search  method mentioned above which results in a match of 695 packages to repositories. We then manually searched the Github URLs for 83 of the remaining unmatched packages, resulting in an addition of 46 packages. In total, for the BuiltWith data we were able to identify 741 out of 778 package-\n\n9 Since the package and package manager names are missing, a precise match using libraries.io was not feasible. Technology names are product names intended for customers and can be less technical and precise than the package names for internal development purposes. Thus, using technology names in a libraries.io search could cause significant ambiguity.\n\nrepository matches. As with the Census data, the remaining 37 unmatched packages (less than 5%) are dropped from our analysis because they had been deleted from GitHub.\n\nGHTorrent database. To obtain measures of the dispersion of the OSS value creation, we utilize  the  GHTorrent  database,  which  contains  the  entire  activity  history  on  GitHub  using GitHub's Representational State Transfer (REST) application programming interface (API). We leveraged  its  records  of  GitHub  repositories,  developer-level  commits,  and  developer  public profile information to estimate the contribution of each developer. We narrowed the sample for our developer contribution analysis in two steps. First, we winnowed the GitHub repositories and their  commits  from  GHTorrent  based  on  the  repository  URLs  of  our  joint  Census-BuiltWith sample. 10 Second, we focus on human contributions to OSS by removing approximately eight thousand (12%) GitHub contributors that we considered to be robots. 11 The final sample contains around sixty thousand developers and 2.3 million commits.\n\nTo prepare these three datasets for estimation, we first identified the number of lines of code and the programming languages used for each package using the OSS packages pygount (to count  the  number  of  lines  of  code)  and  linguist  (to  identify  programming  languages). 12 We categorize each distinct language into one of three different buckets moving from more likely human-written to more likely machine-written (see Table A1). Bucket 1 contains programming and markup languages (which are most likely to be human-written), bucket 3 contains data (most likely to be machine-written), and bucket 2 contains anything in between, such as config files and batch processing (which are sometimes human-written and sometimes machine-written, but it is difficult to tell based purely on looking at the code). 13 For our primary estimation we only use bucket 1 while providing robustness checks for buckets 2 and 3 in the Appendix, and thus our results represent a lower bound. Finally, for some analyses we dig deeper and show the top 5 programming languages (as classified by GitHub, 2022 for the year 2020; the year our data is from). The top 5 programming languages contain C (including C# and C++), Java, JavaScript,\n\n10 The match rate is over 96%, with the unmatched repositories accounting for only 0.15% of our calculated OSS demand value discussed below.\n\n11 The filtering is based on the 'fake user' classification by GHTorrent, as well as any usernames containing words 'bot' or 'robot', surrounded by special characters. This method is more conservative than other methods of bot detection  like  that  used  in  the  GitHub  Innovation  Graph  (https:\/\/innovationgraph.github.com\/),  which  rely  on  a monthly commit frequency threshold.\n\n12 https:\/\/pypi.org\/project\/pygount\/ and https:\/\/github.com\/github-linguist\/linguist\n\n13 Note that our focus is the cost to recreate OSS code written by humans, not robots. However, directly removing all OSS contributions from robot accounts is infeasible here, because we cannot observe the exact lines of code written by the robot accounts on GitHub.\n\nPython, and Typescript.

Panel A and Panel B focus on the supply and demand side estimation for the Census. We obtain a similar pattern that has been established already in the aggregate when pooling both data sources (Figure 1) albeit the impact of JavaScript is substantially lower.  On  the  supply  side  of  the  Census  in  Panel  A,  Java  has  the  second-highest  value  while JavaScript  code  from  the  Census  contributes  to  a  substantially  lower  value  to  the  aggregate. Similarly, the supply side values of C, Python, and Typescript are mainly driven by the Census. From the demand side Panel B we find that Go is the most popular language for inward facing code while all other languages appear to be negligible in relative terms.\n\nFigure 2, Panel C and Panel D show the supply and demand side values for the BuiltWith dataset. The supply side value in Panel C clearly indicates that the value from the BuiltWith sample is driven by JavaScript code, which is a good sanity check since we focused on JavaScript packages to proxy for OSS in the BuiltWith sample, as discussed above. The second highest value is created by TypeScript which is reassuring since it is a superset of JavaScript. Panel D shows a similar pattern  on  the  usage  side  where  most  of  the  value  arises  from  JavaScript  while  TypeScript  is trailing at the second spot as well. The other languages contribute only marginal amounts to the supply and demand side values. Overall, these findings are broadly consistent with the main use cases of the various languages (web programming vs. application programming) and an idea that languages through which value are generated are not necessarily identical to languages that are used by the general public.\n\n--- Figure 3 about here ---\n\nFigure 3 shows the demand-side value of OSS across industries by NAICS 2-digit codes using the BuiltWith online data. 20 This can be interpreted as the value each of these industries receive because OSS exists. The industry with the highest usage value of around $43 billion is 'Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.' 'Retail Trade' as well as 'Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services' make up another large part of the demand-side externally facing value of OSS with $36 billion and $35 billion, respectively. In contrast, industries that constitute just a small portion of the value are 'Mining, Quarrying, and Oil  and  Gas  Extraction',  'Utilities',  'Agriculture,  Forestry,  Fishing,  and  Hunting.'  The  latter industries are classical non-service sector industries and as such software is expected to play less of a role there.\n\nDocument 13: ## --- Figure 1 about here ---\n\nFigure 1 shows the heterogeneity of the value of OSS across the top programming languages. Panel A shows the supply side value with the labor value being displayed on the vertical axis. We find that OSS packages created in Go have the highest value with $803 million in value that would have to be created from scratch if the OSS packages did not exist. Go is closely followed by JavaScript  and  Java  with  $758  million  and  $658  million,  respectively.  The  value  of  C  and Typescript is $406 million and $317 million, respectively, while Python has the lowest value of the top languages with around $55 million. JavaScript is not only the top language on GitHub since at least 2014 (GitHub, 2022) it is also the language with one of the highest values in our data. In contrast, Python became more popular over time moving up from the number four spot to the number two language being used in 2020 across all OSS packages on GitHub, while it is in the last spot of our top languages.\n\nPanel B shows the demand side value across the top programming languages. Based on usage generated value, Go is more than four times the value of the next language, JavaScript.\n\nTypescript (a language that extends JavaScript) has seen immense growth rising from the tenth spot of the top 10 languages in 2017 to the fourth spot in 2020 which is also reflected in our data with  Typescript  being  the  third  most  important  language  on  the  demand  side.  The  two  web languages are followed by C and far behind are Java, and Python.\n\nDocument 16: ## 5. Conclusion\n\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith. We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average value and distributed it across industries.\n\nIn this study we estimate the value of widely-used open source software globally with two unique datasets: the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data.

Our research lays the groundwork for future studies of not only OSS, but of all IT and its growing impact on the global economy.\n\nDocument 12: ## --- Table 1 about here ---\n\nTable  1  shows  descriptive  statistics  from  both  data  sets  separately.  The  inward-facing Census  (Panel  A)  contains  just  over  261.7  million  lines  of  code  with  72%  of  the  lines  being attributable to the top programming languages. The average package includes 142 thousand lines of code with a slightly lower average of 113 thousand lines of code for the subset of top languages. When considering the demand (usage) side, we observe that the Census packages were used over 2.7 million times while 92% of this usage is attributable to the top languages. The average package was used 1,472.4 times with a higher usage of around 1,497.5 for the top  languages.  For  the outward-facing  BuiltWith  data  we  find  similar  patterns,  but  at  different  levels.  The  packages included from BuiltWith include over 82 million lines of code, 71% of which are attributable to the  top  programming  languages.  The  average  package  within  the  BuiltWith  sample  has  111 thousand  lines  of  code  with  a  lower  average  of  around  80  thousand  lines  of  code  for  the  top languages. This is because our BuiltWith data primarily consists of JavaScript-based packages, which are often smaller than packages written in other languages. BuiltWith packages were used over 142 thousand times where 99.97% were attributable to the top languages. Next, we used these raw observations to calculate the value of all OSS through the labor market approach and estimated the value created from the supply and demand side.\n\n--- Table 2 about here ---\n\nTable 2 shows the estimates for the value of OSS based on the firm-relevant joint Census and BuiltWith sample. All estimates in Table 2 are based only on software languages classified in bucket  1  from  Table  A1,  which  are  the  most  likely  to  be  written  by  a  human  rather  than  a machine. 19 The first column contains estimates with wages from a low income country (India), the global  average  wage,  and  a  high  income  country  (United  States  of  America),  respectively  (as described above). To reproduce all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the idea of OSS still exists, but all current OSS is deleted and needs to be coded from scratch), using programmers at the average developer wage from India, it would require an investment of $1.22 billion. In contrast, if we use the average developer wage from the United States, then reproducing all widely-used OSS would require  an  investment  of  $6.22  billion.  Using  a  pool  of  programmers  from  across  the  world, weighed based on the existing geographic contributions to OSS as discussed above, would lead to an investment somewhere in between the low and high-income country, $4.15 billion. It is useful to compare these numbers to those from similar studies to understand differences in valuing all OSS (prior studies) versus that which is widely used (our study). Robbins et al. (2021) and Blind et al. (2021) use a method similar to ours and estimate that the value of OSS created in the US is $38 billion in 2019 and that created in the EU is €1 billion in 2018. Wachs et al. (2022) show that roughly 50% of OSS contributions come from the US and EU combined. In aggregate, that would lead these studies to give a global value of OSS of $78 billion. Thus, our middle estimate of a supply-side value of $4.15 billion for only firm-oriented and widely used OSS is a credible lowerbound and highlights the higher estimations of the total of supply-side value of OSS when not considering whether or not a given OSS package is widely used. This further indicates that the supply-side value of the most widely used OSS is roughly 5.5% of the supply-side value of all OSS.\n\nThe second column in Table 2 contains the demand side estimates based on the labor market approach. We find that if firms had to recreate all OSS packages they used (e.g., OSS itself no longer existed and every firm that used an OSS package had to recreate it), then the entire cost would amount to between $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion using labor from the low wage or high wage country only, respectively. A pool of programmers across the globe could recreate all of OSS that is being widely used for a cost of approximately $8.80 trillion. Interpreting this number is\n\n19 Tables in the appendix show the equivalent values from Table 2 when including software language buckets 1 and 2 (Table A3) and all three software language buckets (Table A4).\n\nslightly more complicated but still feasible. According to a Statista (2023) report, global software revenue in 2020 (the same year as our data) was $531.7 billion. However, this represents a flow, not a stock, of software. Relying on government estimates that software fully depreciates over three years, we can do a back of the envelope calculation and consider the purchase value of the full stock of prepackaged software used in 2020 as the aggregate of that sold from 2018 to 2020, which is $1.54 trillion. Further, this represents only the expenditure on prepackaged software and does  not  include  custom  purchased  or  in-house  developed  software.  Here,  the  best  obtainable estimates of private-sector investment in software overall come from the United States National Income and Product Accounts data (NIPA 2023). In 2020, the national account data shows that in the  US,  private  firms  spent  $479.2  billion  on  software,  of  which  45%  ($215.5  billion)  was prepackaged. If we assume this is a consistent ratio for the rest of the world, then the total amount firms spent on software being used in 2020 was $3.4 trillion (= $1.54 trillion\/0.45). Combining this rough estimate with the demand side estimate of the value of OSS based on an average global wage ($8.8 trillion), this indicates firms would spend $12.2 trillion (=$3.4 trillion + $8.8 trillion), or three and a half times what they currently spend if they needed to pay in-house developers to write the OSS that they currently use for free.","conversation_history":[{"role":"user","content":"I'm interested in the estimated global demand-side value of OSS using programmers from across the world."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How can I help you with that?"}],"metadata":{"question_type":"conversational","seed_document_id":14,"topic":"Others"}}

A  pervasive example is open source software (OSS), a global public good that plays a vital role in the economy and is foundational for most technology we use today. However, it is difficult to measure the value of OSS due to its non-pecuniary nature and lack of centralized usage tracking. Therefore, OSS remains largely unaccounted for in economic measures. Although prior studies have estimated the supply-side costs to recreate this software, a lack of data has hampered estimating the much larger demand-side (usage) value created by OSS. Therefore, to understand the complete economic and social value of widely-used OSS, we leverage unique global data from two complementary sources capturing  OSS  usage  by  millions  of  global  firms.  We  first  estimate  the  supply-side  value  by calculating the cost to recreate the most widely used OSS once. We then calculate the demandside value based on a replacement value for each firm that uses the software and would need to build it internally if OSS did not exist. We estimate the supply-side value of widely-used OSS is $4.15 billion, but that the demand-side value is much larger at $8.8 trillion. We find that firms would need to spend 3.5 times more on software than they currently do if OSS did not exist. The top six programming languages in our sample comprise 84% of the demand-side value of OSS. Further, 96% of the demand-side value is created by only 5% of OSS developers.\n\nJEL Classification:\n\nH4; O3; J0\n\nKeywords: Open-source software, global public good\n\nAcknowledgement: The authors are grateful for  financial  and  administrative  support  from  the Linux  Foundation  without  which  the  data  from  the  Census  would  not  have  otherwise  been available.

Introduction\n\nIn 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that 'software is eating the world' (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that 'open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,' (Jacks, 2022). Other recent studies have come to similar conclusions showing that open source software  (OSS)  -  software  whose  source  code  is  publicly  available  for  inspection,  use,  and modification and is often created in a decentralized manner and distributed for free - appears in 96% of codebases (Synopsys 2023), and that some commercial software consists of up to 99.9% freely available OSS (Musseau et al., 2022). Although in its early days OSS frequently copied features from existing proprietary software, OSS today includes cutting edge technology in various fields including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, big data, and analytics.  However, despite the increasing importance of OSS to all software (and therefore to the entire economy), measuring its impact has been elusive. Traditionally, to measure the value created by a good or service,  economists  multiply  the  price  ( p )  times  the  quantity  sold  ( q ).  However,  in  OSS, p is generally zero since the source code is publicly available, and q is  unknown due to the limited number of restrictions around how the code may be copied and reused. For example, if a company downloads  a  piece  of  OSS  from  a  public  code  repository,  it  may  copy  it  thousands  of  times internally (legally) and then share it with suppliers or customers (also legally), so public download data is insufficient. Although some recent studies have sought to estimate the value of p (discussed below), data for estimating q has been unavailable or intractable for anything more than just a handful of OSS packages. Using newly collected data from multiple sources, the goal of this paper is to provide estimates for both p and q and to use those to shine light on the question: What is the value of open source software?\n\nUnderstanding the value of OSS is of critical importance not only due to the role it plays in the economy, but also due to it being one of the most successful and impactful modern examples of the centuries old economic concept of 'the commons' which run the risk of meeting the fate known as 'the tragedy of the commons.' This concept can trace its roots as far back as the 4 th -century BC philosopher Aristotle who wrote 'That which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care. Men pay most attention to what is their own and care less for what is common.'  (Aristotle,  1981).  William  Forster  Lloyd  (1833)  resurfaced  the  idea  in  modern economic thought by highlighting the example of shared tracts of land used for cattle grazing by\n\nmultiple cattle herders who each had an incentive to overuse the shared resource. Garrett Hardin (1968)  brought  the  concept  into  the  broader  zeitgeist  when  he  wrote  an  article  discussing  the problem entitled 'The Tragedy of the Commons.' Building on this work, Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for her research highlighting paths to avoiding the tragedy of the commons through community coordination efforts that did not necessitate government enforced laws to manage and guard the commons (Ostrom 1990). The parallels between shared grazing lands and shared digital infrastructure are palpable - the availability of communal grass to feed cattle, and in turn feed people, was critical to the agrarian economy, and the ability to not have to recreate code that someone else has already written is critical to the modern economy. Further, in both contexts, despite knowing grass and code are critical inputs to the economy, measuring their actual value is difficult. And, as the renowned mathematician and physicist Lord Kelvin is believed to have said, 'If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.' And if you cannot improve and maintain it, such common goods may crumble under the weight of their own success as they are overused, but underinvested in (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021). Therefore, measuring the value OSS creates is crucial to the future health of the digital economy, and the rest of the economy that is built on top of it.\n\nImportantly, recent studies have attempted to address these measurement issues but fall short of capturing both the breadth and depth of OSS usage - a gap we seek to fill with this paper. For example, researchers have attempted to gain breadth by using novel methodologies to estimate the labor replacement value of the current corpus of OSS created in the United States at $38 billion in 2019 (Robbins et al., 2021) and that created in the European Union at €1 billion (Blind et al., 2021) by imputing the labor costs that it would have taken to rewrite existing OSS. Such efforts do a very good job at estimating what it would cost to replace all existing OSS if it disappeared tomorrow. However, the resultant estimates rely on two important assumptions. First, that all OSS is equally valuable from a usage standpoint, and second that the concept of OSS would still exist, and society would just need to rewrite the code once, thus addressing the aforementioned problem of a missing value for p , but not addressing the missing value of q . In a world where OSS did not exist at all, then each piece of OSS software would not need to be rewritten just once, but instead would need to be rewritten by every firm that used the software (assuming the firm could freely share the software within its boundaries). Other research (Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; MurcianoGoroff, Zhuo, and Greenstein, 2021) has gone deeper into this hypothetical, albeit in a narrow\n\nmanner, by only focusing on web servers (which are public facing on the Internet and can therefore be readily measured). Using different methods, both studies measure q for this one type of software and impute p by using a goods replacement value approach based on the prices for closed-source alternatives offered by firms. With data from the United States the resulting estimates show a value of  $2  billion  for  the  OSS  Apache  Web  Server  in  2012  (Greenstein  and  Nagle,  2014)  and  a combined value of $4.5 billion for Apache and the increasingly popular OSS web server nginx in 2018 (Murciano-Goroff, et al., 2021). However, although web servers are an important part of the OSS  ecosystem,  they  constitute  a  small  portion  of  it.  We  seek  to  build  upon  the  important contributions this existing research has made in an attempt to go both broad and deep to create a more complete measure of the value of OSS.\n\nTo consider the value of OSS in both a broad and deep manner, we use data from two primary sources that allow us to gain insights into the OSS used at tens of thousands of firms across the world. The first is the 'Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries' (Nagle et al., 2022). The Census II project utilized partnerships with multiple software composition analysis (SCA) firms to create various lists of the most widely used OSS. SCAs are hired to scan the codebases of a company to ensure they are not violating any OSS licenses and, as a byproduct, track all the OSS code used by their customers and the products they build. The Census II project aggregated data from multiple SCAs to build a dataset of OSS usage at tens of thousands of firms based  on  millions  of  data  points  (observations  of  OSS  usage).  The  second  data  source  is  the BuiltWith dataset, from which we leverage scans of nearly nine million websites to identify the underlying technology deployed by these websites, including OSS libraries. The BuiltWith data has been used in multiple academic studies (DeStefano &amp; Timmis 2023, Dushnitsky &amp; Stroube 2021, Koning et al.. 2022), but to our knowledge this is the first one to focus on OSS usage. The Census II data and the BuiltWith data are complementary as the former focuses on OSS that is built  into  the  software  a  company  sells,  while  the  latter  focuses  on  OSS  that  is  built  into  a company's website, thus reducing the chances of double-counting observations across the datasets. In aggregate, these two datasets combined create the most complete measurement of OSS usage ( q ) to date. Further, by focusing on OSS that is widely deployed and used by firms, rather than considering all the projects that exist in an OSS repository, we enhance the methodologies of prior studies by reducing the likelihood of measurement error stemming from projects that are posted as publicly available OSS but are not actually used in any practical manner. Not accounting for this\n\nmeasurement error would lead to overestimation of the actual value of OSS as projects that are widely used would be valued in the same way as projects that are not used at all.\n\nTo estimate p ,  we  follow  the  literature  discussed  above  and  use  the  labor  replacement value. First, we calculate the labor cost it would take an individual firm to recreate a given OSS package by measuring the number of lines of code within the package and then applying the Constructive Cost Model II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) - also known as COCOMO II to estimate the number of person-hours it would take to write the code from scratch. We then utilize global wage data from Salary Expert to get an accurate estimate of the labor costs a firm would incur if this piece of OSS did not exist. These costs can be combined with the q values from above at the OSS package level to estimate the combined value of all OSS from both the supply and demand sides.\n\nWe find a value ranging from $1.22 billion to $6.22 billion if we were to decide as a society to recreate all widely used OSS on the supply side. However, considering the actual usage of OSS leads to a demand-side value that is orders of magnitude larger and ranges from $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion, if each firm who used an OSS package had to recreate it from scratch (e.g., the concept of OSS did not exist). We document substantial heterogeneity of the value of OSS by programming  language  and  internal  vs  outward-facing  programming  efforts.  Further,  we  find considerable  heterogeneity  in  value  contributions  by  programmers  as  5%  of  programmers  are responsible for more than 90% of the value created on the supply- and demand- side. The data we use is arguably the most comprehensive source of data to measure the value created by firm usage of OSS at this time. However, as for any project, the evidence is not complete and we argue that we underestimate the value since our data, e.g., does not include operating systems, which are a substantial omitted category of OSS.\n\nThis study makes four important contributions to the academic literature, practitioners, and policy makers. First, it provides the most complete estimate of the value of widely used OSS to date  by  accounting  for  not  only  the  supply-side  of  OSS  (price  to  create  it),  but  also  for  the usage\/demand-side at a scale that has not been done before. While prior estimates of the value of OSS only went either broad (estimating the supply-side costs of a large swath of OSS) or deep (estimating the value created by one particular type of OSS), this study does both by using unique datasets that allow for a better understanding of the breadth and depth of OSS usage. Further, rather than measuring the value of all OSS, this study focuses on the value of OSS that is used by firms\n\nto create its products and websites, limiting the measurement error occurring in studies that are unable to account for which OSS is actually used in production. This contribution builds upon, and extends, important research (e.g., Blind et al., 2021; Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021; Robbins et al., 2021) that has sought to identify the value of this vital resource that contributes a great deal to the modern economy despite the difficulties measuring this contribution. In  doing  so,  it  adds  insights  to  a  long-running  discussion  related  to  the  impact  of  information technology (IT) on productivity (Brynjolfsson, 1993; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 1996; Nagle, 2019a; Solow, 1987) known as the 'productivity paradox' where IT investments can have limited impact on productivity statistics. This debate has continued into the emerging context of AI (Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson, 2018). Our work contributes to this conversation by highlighting a massive societal level cost-savings (and hence productivity enhancement) that is created by the existence of OSS.\n\nSecond, our research contributes methodological advances to the study of intangible capital by highlighting novel sources of data related to investments in OSS. Prior research has shown that intangible capital plays an increasingly important role in economic growth (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel,  2009)  and  firm  value  (Peters  and  Taylor,  2017),  but  it  often  goes  unmeasured  or misattributed (Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou, 2014). Further, we demonstrate how these data sources can be used to understand the true investments in software that a firm makes, and that which they would have to make if OSS did not exist.  This  is  valuable  as  investments  in  software  are  an increasingly important type of intangible capital that is driving innovation (Branstetter, Drev, and Kwon, 2019) and performance (Krishnan et al., 2000).\n\nThird, our results help highlight for firms and managers the importance of OSS to their production, and ideally add weight to arguments that users of OSS should not just free ride but also contribute to the creation and maintenance of OSS (e.g., Henkel, 2008; Nagle, 2018). Such contributions are a fraction of the costs that firms would incur if OSS did not exist and the active participation of OSS users in helping maintain the OSS they use is critical to the health and future well-being of the OSS ecosystem (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021; Zhang et al., 2019).\n\nFourth,  and  finally,  our  study  helps  inform  policymakers  who  have  recently  started  to understand  the  growing  importance  of  OSS  to  the  economy  and  taken  actions  to  support  the ecosystem (European Commission, 2020; Executive Order No. 14028, 2021). However, most of these efforts are related to securing the existing OSS ecosystem, which is quite important, but do\n\nnot go as far as supporting the creation of new OSS. Our results help shine light on the importance of OSS to the overall economy and add weight to calls for more societal support of this critical resource. Our results further show that the majority of the value created by OSS is created by a small  number  of  contributors.  Although  it  has  long  been  known  that  a  small  number  of  OSS contributors do most of the work, we add new insights that show this is even more true for the value creation of widely-used OSS projects and that societal support for these individuals is critical to the future success of OSS, and in turn, the economy.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the empirical setting and data. Section 3 discusses the methods including measurement challenges. In section 4, we estimate the value of open source software. Section 5 concludes.\n\nDocument 16: ## 5. Conclusion\n\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith. We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average value and distributed it across industries.\n\nIn this study we estimate the value of widely-used open source software globally with two unique datasets: the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data. We are able to estimate not only the supply side value of existing code (e.g., the cost it would take to rewrite each piece of widely-used OSS once) but also the demand side value for the private economy (e.g., the cost it would take for each company that uses a piece of OSS to rewrite it). While we do not focus on the long tail of OSS, we consider this an additional contribution of our study as focusing on OSS that is widely used allows us to more precisely understand the value created by OSS, rather than only measuring the  replacement  cost  for  all  OSS  (which  would  overestimate  the  true  value  since  many  OSS projects are not used in production code). However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n\nAdjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.  We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves.  Over  95%  percent  of  the  demand-side  value  is  generated  by  only  five  percent  of programmers, and those programmers contribute not only to a few widely used projects but to substantially more projects than the programmers that are engaged at the lower end of the value distribution.\n\nIn aggregate, our results show the substantial value that OSS contributes to the economy despite this value generally showing up as zero via direct measurement since prices equal zero and quantity is difficult to measure using public data alone. Our research lays the groundwork for future studies of not only OSS, but of all IT and its growing impact on the global economy.","conversation_history":[{"role":"user","content":"The study estimates the demand-side value of widely-used open source software (OSS) globally."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How can I help you with that?"}],"metadata":{"question_type":"conversational","seed_document_id":5,"topic":"Others"}}

Panel A shows the supply side value with the labor value being displayed on the vertical axis. We find that OSS packages created in Go have the highest value with $803 million in value that would have to be created from scratch if the OSS packages did not exist. Go is closely followed by JavaScript  and  Java  with  $758  million  and  $658  million,  respectively.  The  value  of  C  and Typescript is $406 million and $317 million, respectively, while Python has the lowest value of the top languages with around $55 million. JavaScript is not only the top language on GitHub since at least 2014 (GitHub, 2022) it is also the language with one of the highest values in our data. In contrast, Python became more popular over time moving up from the number four spot to the number two language being used in 2020 across all OSS packages on GitHub, while it is in the last spot of our top languages.\n\nPanel B shows the demand side value across the top programming languages. Based on usage generated value, Go is more than four times the value of the next language, JavaScript.\n\nTypescript (a language that extends JavaScript) has seen immense growth rising from the tenth spot of the top 10 languages in 2017 to the fourth spot in 2020 which is also reflected in our data with  Typescript  being  the  third  most  important  language  on  the  demand  side.  The  two  web languages are followed by C and far behind are Java, and Python.\n\nDocument 14: ## --- Figure 2 about here ---\n\nFigure 2 splits the OSS value estimates for each language by our inward facing (Census) and outward facing (BuiltWith) data sources. Panel A and Panel B focus on the supply and demand side estimation for the Census. We obtain a similar pattern that has been established already in the aggregate when pooling both data sources (Figure 1) albeit the impact of JavaScript is substantially lower.  On  the  supply  side  of  the  Census  in  Panel  A,  Java  has  the  second-highest  value  while JavaScript  code  from  the  Census  contributes  to  a  substantially  lower  value  to  the  aggregate. Similarly, the supply side values of C, Python, and Typescript are mainly driven by the Census. From the demand side Panel B we find that Go is the most popular language for inward facing code while all other languages appear to be negligible in relative terms.\n\nFigure 2, Panel C and Panel D show the supply and demand side values for the BuiltWith dataset. The supply side value in Panel C clearly indicates that the value from the BuiltWith sample is driven by JavaScript code, which is a good sanity check since we focused on JavaScript packages to proxy for OSS in the BuiltWith sample, as discussed above. The second highest value is created by TypeScript which is reassuring since it is a superset of JavaScript. Panel D shows a similar pattern  on  the  usage  side  where  most  of  the  value  arises  from  JavaScript  while  TypeScript  is trailing at the second spot as well. The other languages contribute only marginal amounts to the supply and demand side values. Overall, these findings are broadly consistent with the main use cases of the various languages (web programming vs. application programming) and an idea that languages through which value are generated are not necessarily identical to languages that are used by the general public.\n\n--- Figure 3 about here ---\n\nFigure 3 shows the demand-side value of OSS across industries by NAICS 2-digit codes using the BuiltWith online data. 20 This can be interpreted as the value each of these industries receive because OSS exists. The industry with the highest usage value of around $43 billion is 'Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.' 'Retail Trade' as well as 'Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services' make up another large part of the demand-side externally facing value of OSS with $36 billion and $35 billion, respectively. In contrast, industries that constitute just a small portion of the value are 'Mining, Quarrying, and Oil  and  Gas  Extraction',  'Utilities',  'Agriculture,  Forestry,  Fishing,  and  Hunting.'  The  latter industries are classical non-service sector industries and as such software is expected to play less of a role there.\n\nDocument 12: ## --- Table 1 about here ---\n\nTable  1  shows  descriptive  statistics  from  both  data  sets  separately.  The  inward-facing Census  (Panel  A)  contains  just  over  261.7  million  lines  of  code  with  72%  of  the  lines  being attributable to the top programming languages. The average package includes 142 thousand lines of code with a slightly lower average of 113 thousand lines of code for the subset of top languages. When considering the demand (usage) side, we observe that the Census packages were used over 2.7 million times while 92% of this usage is attributable to the top languages. The average package was used 1,472.4 times with a higher usage of around 1,497.5 for the top  languages.  For  the outward-facing  BuiltWith  data  we  find  similar  patterns,  but  at  different  levels.  The  packages included from BuiltWith include over 82 million lines of code, 71% of which are attributable to the  top  programming  languages.  The  average  package  within  the  BuiltWith  sample  has  111 thousand  lines  of  code  with  a  lower  average  of  around  80  thousand  lines  of  code  for  the  top languages. This is because our BuiltWith data primarily consists of JavaScript-based packages, which are often smaller than packages written in other languages. BuiltWith packages were used over 142 thousand times where 99.97% were attributable to the top languages. Next, we used these raw observations to calculate the value of all OSS through the labor market approach and estimated the value created from the supply and demand side.\n\n--- Table 2 about here ---\n\nTable 2 shows the estimates for the value of OSS based on the firm-relevant joint Census and BuiltWith sample. All estimates in Table 2 are based only on software languages classified in bucket  1  from  Table  A1,  which  are  the  most  likely  to  be  written  by  a  human  rather  than  a machine. 19 The first column contains estimates with wages from a low income country (India), the global  average  wage,  and  a  high  income  country  (United  States  of  America),  respectively  (as described above). To reproduce all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the idea of OSS still exists, but all current OSS is deleted and needs to be coded from scratch), using programmers at the average developer wage from India, it would require an investment of $1.22 billion. In contrast, if we use the average developer wage from the United States, then reproducing all widely-used OSS would require  an  investment  of  $6.22  billion.  Using  a  pool  of  programmers  from  across  the  world, weighed based on the existing geographic contributions to OSS as discussed above, would lead to an investment somewhere in between the low and high-income country, $4.15 billion. It is useful to compare these numbers to those from similar studies to understand differences in valuing all OSS (prior studies) versus that which is widely used (our study). Robbins et al. (2021) and Blind et al. (2021) use a method similar to ours and estimate that the value of OSS created in the US is $38 billion in 2019 and that created in the EU is €1 billion in 2018. Wachs et al. (2022) show that roughly 50% of OSS contributions come from the US and EU combined. In aggregate, that would lead these studies to give a global value of OSS of $78 billion. Thus, our middle estimate of a supply-side value of $4.15 billion for only firm-oriented and widely used OSS is a credible lowerbound and highlights the higher estimations of the total of supply-side value of OSS when not considering whether or not a given OSS package is widely used. This further indicates that the supply-side value of the most widely used OSS is roughly 5.5% of the supply-side value of all OSS.\n\nThe second column in Table 2 contains the demand side estimates based on the labor market approach. We find that if firms had to recreate all OSS packages they used (e.g., OSS itself no longer existed and every firm that used an OSS package had to recreate it), then the entire cost would amount to between $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion using labor from the low wage or high wage country only, respectively. A pool of programmers across the globe could recreate all of OSS that is being widely used for a cost of approximately $8.80 trillion. Interpreting this number is\n\n19 Tables in the appendix show the equivalent values from Table 2 when including software language buckets 1 and 2 (Table A3) and all three software language buckets (Table A4).\n\nslightly more complicated but still feasible. According to a Statista (2023) report, global software revenue in 2020 (the same year as our data) was $531.7 billion. However, this represents a flow, not a stock, of software. Relying on government estimates that software fully depreciates over three years, we can do a back of the envelope calculation and consider the purchase value of the full stock of prepackaged software used in 2020 as the aggregate of that sold from 2018 to 2020, which is $1.54 trillion. Further, this represents only the expenditure on prepackaged software and does  not  include  custom  purchased  or  in-house  developed  software.  Here,  the  best  obtainable estimates of private-sector investment in software overall come from the United States National Income and Product Accounts data (NIPA 2023). In 2020, the national account data shows that in the  US,  private  firms  spent  $479.2  billion  on  software,  of  which  45%  ($215.5  billion)  was prepackaged. If we assume this is a consistent ratio for the rest of the world, then the total amount firms spent on software being used in 2020 was $3.4 trillion (= $1.54 trillion\/0.45). Combining this rough estimate with the demand side estimate of the value of OSS based on an average global wage ($8.8 trillion), this indicates firms would spend $12.2 trillion (=$3.4 trillion + $8.8 trillion), or three and a half times what they currently spend if they needed to pay in-house developers to write the OSS that they currently use for free.","conversation_history":[{"role":"user","content":"I am interested in the estimated cost to recreate all widely-used OSS using programmers from a high-income country like the United States."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How can I help you with that?"}],"metadata":{"question_type":"conversational","seed_document_id":13,"topic":"Others"}}
{"id":"658c721c-fa29-473c-9a07-48ac70f71650","question":"What is that method?","reference_answer":"The goods-market valuation approach estimates the value of OSS by considering the costs if all commercial users of the free OSS had to replace that software with pecuniary alternatives. This involves creating a basket of equivalent substitute proprietary goods priced on the open market as stand-ins for OSS products. The approach assumes a fixed price for selling a good multiple times, which is usually lower than the total value estimated from recreating all packages on the labor side. The goods-market value is calculated by obtaining prices for each proprietary software equivalent and using the COCOMO labor market supply-side value as a proxy for the proprietary software's value. The approach ultimately results in a substantially smaller goods-market value compared to the labor demand value.","reference_context":"Document 21: ## Appendix A) Goods-Market Valuation Approach\n\nAs an alternate estimation method, instead of using the labor replacement cost, we use a goods replacement value approach. We identify several OSS packages that have similar closed-source, pecuniary alternatives and consider the costs if all commercial users of the free OSS had to replace that software with a pecuniary alternative (similar to the calculations Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) performed for web servers). We can then use this alternate value of p , combined with the q values from above to estimate a goods replacement value of OSS. This method builds on suggestions from Nordhaus (2006, p. 146) who says '…the price of market and nonmarket goods and services should be imputed on the basis of the comparable market goods and services.' We do not expect the estimates from the two methods to be similar. Quite the contrary, the value of those two methods varies substantially since the latter goods-market approach assumes a fixed price to sell a good multiple times and that fixed price is usually lower than the total value estimated from recreating all packages on the labor side. The differential between these estimates is  essentially the result of a firm stepping in to reproduce the missing OSS packages and then selling them for a pecuniary price rather than all firms needing to reproduce those packages from scratch themselves.\n\nWith the goods market approach, the thought experiment is still that we live in a world where OSS does not exist, but it has to be recreated via one firm that then charges a price for a good that is currently free. To value OSS via the goods market approach, we created a basket of equivalent substitute proprietary goods that are priced on the open market as a stand-in for an OSS product.  This  methodology  is  consistent  with  that  used  in  the  prior  literature  (Greenstein  and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021) although both of those studies only used a single good rather than a basket since they were focused on only one type of OSS (web servers). Since there is no readily available database for proprietary equivalents of OSS, we conduct a search based on subjective  perception  of  popularity  of  OSS  and  we  then  search  for  pecuniary,  closed-source substitutes for them. The resulting basket of 20 OSS packages with proprietary substitutes is a good representation of the diversity of OSS. The software ranges from media and design software to statistical analysis programs, to database management and web server software. 21\n\n21 Table A5 shows the basket of OSS and their proprietary equivalents that we used. To create this basket, we looked for proprietary software that had an OSS equivalent that was similar in its overall function and feature set, and sought to identify pairs of software that, in aggregate, captured a broad and representative set of the types of OSS that exist.\n\nBased on our OSS equivalent substitute proprietary goods basket we then obtain prices for each proprietary software equivalent and we calculated the COCOMO labor market supply-side value for each OSS product in the basket which we use as a proxy - for lack of the code from the proprietary software - for the COCOMO labor supply side value of the proprietary software (e.g., the cost it would take to pay a programmer to write that proprietary software from scratch). We then calculate the average COCOMO labor supply-side value of the basket, 𝑉 !,1#23.4 ,  and  the average price for the basket, 𝑃 !,1#23.4 . 22 Since, we know the labor market supply-side value of all OSS, 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; , we can setup the following equation and obtain the price of OSS, 𝑃 ! for the goodsmarket for all OSS via a simple scaling transformation:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nThis results in the following goods-market supply-side value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nWe can then obtain the equivalent demand-side goods-market values as follows:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nFrom the goods market side, we consider the equivalent price that a firm would charge if it produced all existing widely used OSS and then sold it as a product to customers.\n\nTable A6, column 3 shows that the value on the demand side ranges between $177 million and $244 million across the different buckets independent of the country of origin from which programmers are hired. Naturally, the goods-market value will be substantially smaller than the labor demand value since this imaginary firm will make a profit at a comparatively low price by producing the software once and then selling it to many customers. Further, while Greenstein and Nagle (2014) as well as Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) focus on one particular type of software only (web servers), we attempt to expand on their approach to many goods. However, the data limitations become a stronger constraint in this context which makes it inherently more difficult\n\n22 We obtained the average price of the goods-market proprietary basket by using a 3 years lifespan of software, i.e. 1\/(1-0.66), so the depreciation factor is 0.33. This is consistent with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules for depreciating software, which states 'If you can depreciate the cost of computer software, use the straight line method over a useful life of 36 months.' https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/publications\/p946#en\\_US\\_2022\\_publink1000107354.\n\nto  estimate  the  value  through  this  approach  while  requiring  substantially  more  assumptions. Instead of a pure goods-market approach, this requires assistance from the labor-market approach in terms of scaling for the estimate, which ultimately leads to a substantial underestimate of the value of OSS. Further, the pricing strategy of the proprietary software counterparts is sensitive to the  market  demand.  With  the  goods-market  approach  extending  to  multiple  goods,  the  strong implicit assumption is that the market demands for our basket software and our sample OSS are similar, so they lead to commensurate prices.\n\nAn alternative and even more simplified goods-market back-of-the-envelope calculation that does not account for lines of code and relies on no scaling from the labor market approach would simply be to multiply a price of a reference good with the usage. We can take the minimum, average, and maximum prices of the basket of proprietary goods as captured in the reference price vector p = (69.99, 1610.17, 5800) and simply multiply it with usage from the combined Census and BuiltWith sample (Table 1). Based on those imputed proprietary price assumptions, the goods market demand side value would range from $0.2 - $16.5 trillion (minimum price - maximum price)  with  the  mean  price  resulting  in  a  value  estimate  of  $4.5  trillion.  However,  while  this estimate creates slightly more variance than the labor market approach, it is inherently flawed by simply assuming that the imputed prices are identical for each open source product based on the reference price. We further think this very simple back-of-the-envelope is an orange to apples comparison since the goods in our basket are fully functional, stand-alone software packages, while the packages in the Census and BuiltWith datasets are comprised of application libraries, which are generally smaller than such stand-alone packages.\n\nGiven all the complexities and assumptions one has to make due to lack of data for a goodsmarket approach, we place stronger emphasis on the labor cost approach highlighted in the main body but we include this method here for completeness.\n\nDocument 9: ## 3.1 Labor market approach\n\nFor the labor market approach, we estimate the value of OSS by calculating the replacement value of a package. We ask how much it would cost to reproduce the package by hiring a programmer and paying them a competitive market wage. To estimate this supply-side value ( 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; ) , we take the complete list of OSS packages discussed above, and then count the lines of code in each unique\n\n14 In an alternative version, we use a mixture of a labor and goods market approach that is more closely aligned with Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff, et al (2021). However, applying this method in our setting requires numerous additional assumptions due to data constraints. For simplicity we call it the goods market approach for which we provide the details and statistics, as well as the limitations in Appendix A.\n\npackage. 15 For each unique package,  , we calculate the value and then sum over all these values i to obtain the total value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nIn this calculation, we implicitly do not incorporate any production externalities since we assume that there is no spillover knowledge from one package to the next that would lower the cost of programming. 16 This methodology is similar to that used by other papers that estimate the supply-side costs of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021).\n\nWe then calculate the demand-side value of OSS by incorporating the usage information ( Q) for each package:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nHere, we do not incorporate consumption externalities, i.e., we do not allow a benefit to arise for the general public when a package has been created and we further make sure that each firm is only replacing a package they use once, since a replaced package can be used within a firm as a club good (e.g., see Cornes and Sandler, 1996). The value 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost to rewrite all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the concept of OSS still exists, but all of these packages needed to be rewritten from scratch), while the value 𝑉 + \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost for each firm that uses one of these OSS packages to pay a developer to rewrite those packages (e.g., OSS itself no longer exists).\n\nFor both the supply and demand models, we obtain the dollar-value for each package ( 𝑃 ( ) via the Constructive Cost Model II, also abbreviated as COCOMO II (Boehm 1984, Boehm et al. 2009). The model has previously been used by the United States Department of Defense to estimate software project costs as well as in prior research estimating the value of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021). It is a highly flexible model that allows us to create non-linear transformations of lines of code to dollar-values. It uses the following modelling equation:\n\n15 We use only the pure lines of code excluding documentation lines and empty lines. Hence, we underestimate the true value of recreating each package.\n\n16 Similar to a representative agent model (e.g. see Williamson 2006), one may think of each package being reproduced by separate programmers who are identical replicas of each other (and therefore have the same skill level, but do not become more efficient via learning).\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n( (\n\nwhere 𝐿 represents the lines of codes in thousands and E the effort in person-month units for each project  . Consistent with Blind et al. (2021), we use the default parameter values for i 𝛼 , 𝛽 and 𝜂. The parameters 𝛼 𝛽 , are non-linear adjustment factors set to 2.94, and 1.0997 respectively . The parameter 𝜂 is an effort-adjustment factor which can be modified to incorporate subjective assessments of product, hardware, personnel, and project attributes. Since we do not have a prior for each project, we set 𝜂 to the default value of one. To obtain the price ( 𝑃 ( ) of each OSS project, we  then  multiply  the  results  of  equation  (3)  by  the  weighted  global  wage  that  an  average programmer would obtain on the open market. To calculate a global wage, we include the base monthly salaries of software developers from Salary Expert for the top 30 countries in terms of their GitHub developer counts in 2021 (Wachs et al., 2022). 17 The weight of each country is its share of active GitHub contributors over the total contributors in the top 30 countries. We further create bounds by using a low-wage (India) and high-wage (USA) labor market for the wage to better understand how the value would vary by the pool of programmers used to recreate all of OSS. 18\n\nDocument 8: ## 3. Methodology\n\nWe first measure the value of OSS by considering the supply and the demand side of OSS using a labor market approach. 14 The thought experiment is that we live in a world where OSS does not exist and has to be recreated at each firm that uses a given piece of OSS. Using the labor market approach, we calculate the labor replacement cost of each OSS package. To estimate the value for each package, we use COCOMO II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) at the individual package level and then sum across all package values to obtain a supply-side labor market replacement value. Then, we scale the supply-side value by the number of times firms are using each package while removing multi-usage within each firm to obtain a demand-side value.\n\nSecond, we move beyond the aggregate and inspect inequality in the value creation process. In OSS, as with many creative endeavors, it is common that a small handful of individuals provide the bulk of the contributions, while many others make small contributions (sometimes referred to as the 80\/20 rule, implying 80% of the work is done by 20% of the people). Research has shown these frequent contributors often attain positions of influence in OSS communities as a result of their efforts (Hanisch, et al, 2018). Therefore, to better understand the dispersion of value creation across developers, we first use the GHTorrent data and identify individual developer contributions in two ways: a) through their OSS value contributions directly and b) through the total number of repositories they contributed to. We then test how concentrated these two contribution measures are to better understand whether many or few developers contribute to the total value we measure. We explain the exact details for the labor market approach and the inequality of valuations below.","conversation_history":[{"role":"user","content":"I am interested in the goods-market valuation approach for estimating the value of OSS as described by the Harvard Business School's OSS report."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How can I help you with that?"}],"metadata":{"question_type":"conversational","seed_document_id":21,"topic":"Others"}}

{"id":"52450cf0-f461-433a-8442-5e5b8894beba","question":"What are they?","reference_answer":"The two main data sources used to estimate the value of OSS in the study are the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data.","reference_context":"Document 7: ## 2. Empirical Setting and Data\n\nAlthough the concept of free and open software has existed since the 1950's, it became more popular in the 1980's due to the efforts of Richard Stallman and his launch of the GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation (Maracke, 2019). However, it was in the 1990's that OSS took off after Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel, a now widely adopted OSS operating system (Tozzi, 2016). Today, OSS is considered a key building block of the digital economy and is widely used by software developers in everything from phones to cars to refrigerators to cutting-edge AI (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021).\n\nWe use two complementary main data sources to estimate the value of OSS. The first is the Census and is inward facing. It allows us to identify OSS code that goes into products that firms create. The second dataset is BuiltWith and is outward facing, allowing us to identify OSS code  that  consumers  directly  interact  with  through  firm  websites.  Since  the  raw  data  in  both datasets only contains package names, version numbers, and package manager names, and does not  contain  any  source  code  related  information,  we  first  obtain  the  publicly  accessible  code repository for each package which includes package-level information including the lines of code and  the  programming  languages  used.  One  may  worry  about  double-counting  for  the  value calculations as a result of using two separate datasets. However, the overlap of both the Census and  the  BuiltWith  sample  is  very  small:  there  are  only  18  packages  found  in  both  datasets. Moreover, it is unlikely that double counting is a concern as the two datasets capture different dimensions of OSS usage: the Census captures packaged software whose usage is inward-facing while BuiltWith captures usage in websites that are outward-facing. Finally, as a supplementary\n\ndataset, we use GHTorrent, a detailed history of OSS-related activity on GitHub, the most popular OSS hosting platform and a commonly used data source for studies of OSS (e.g., Burton et al, 2017; Conti, Peukert, and Roche, 2023; Fackler, Hofmann, and Laurentsyeva, 2023; Kim, 2020; Tang, Wang, &amp; Tong, 2023). This detailed historical data allows us to go deeper into how the value  of  OSS  is  created  by  better  understanding  the  dispersion  of  the  contributions  across individual OSS developers. We describe the details of all three data sources and their preparation for estimation below.\n\nCensus. The  Census  II  of  Free  and  Open  Source  Software  (here:  Census)  was  jointly undertaken by the Linux Foundation and the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (Nagle et  al.,  2022). 1 The  Census  was  created  via  the  aggregation  of  data  from  three  major  software composition analysis (SCA) firms with thousands of clients across the globe. SCAs are hired to scan the codebase of a client and gather the OSS usage embedded in their proprietary software to ensure they are not violating any OSS license agreements.  Frequently this takes place as part of 2 the due diligence process related to mergers and acquisitions. Unlike other OSS demand measures available from public sources such as package download counts and code changes, the way this data was collected ensures that we observe the precise amount and type of internal OSS usage of the firms. In addition, it allows us to trace the dependencies each package relies on, so that we can observe the indirect OSS usage that is commonly hidden and difficult to obtain.  The result is over 3 2.7 million observations of OSS packages being used within products created by the SCA client firms for the calendar year 2020 (January 1 to December 31, 2020). 4\n\nThe Census project standardized package names based on the naming system of libraries.io -  a  widely  used  site  maintained  by  Tidelift  that  organizes  information  about  more  than  eight million open source packages. The Census focused on the top 2,000 packages based on usage\n\n1 The precise methodologies for the data collection and aggregation are detailed in the Census report by Nagle et al (2022).\n\n2 OSS usage licenses vary a great deal and while some licenses are very open and allow the code to be reused in any manner, including within proprietary code that will be made available for sale at a non-zero price, other licenses restrict reuse to only be allowed if the resultant code is released under the same OSS license (known as copyleft). A detailed discussion of OSS licenses can be found in Lerner and Tirole (2005) and Almeida et al (2017).\n\n3 Indirect OSS usage is captured by dependency analysis and is necessary to accurately measure the full breadth of the OSS a firm relies on. For example, if a firm's proprietary code calls OSS package A, but package A, in turn, calls package B, then only looking at the direct calls would miss that package B was a required building block for the firm's proprietary code.\n\n4 The Census defines an OSS package as 'a unit of software that can be installed and managed by a package manager,' and  defines  a  package  manager  as  'software  that  automates  the  process  of  installing  and  otherwise  managing packages' (Nagle et al, 2022).\n\nreported from the three of the most prominent SCA vendors to identify the most widely used OSS rather  than  the  long-tail  of  the  usage  distribution.  This  led  to  packages  with  less  than  five observations  of  usage  being  dropped.  Since  packages  written  in  the  JavaScript  programming language, and usually hosted on the Node Package Manager (NPM), are generally smaller (fewer lines  of  code)  than  packages  in  other  languages  and  therefore  frequently  have  higher  usage numbers (since developers must include many small packages instead of a few large packages), the Census separately selected the top 1,000 NPM packages and the top 1,000 non-NPM hosted packages.\n\nThis final dataset covers 70% of the total usage of OSS observed in the raw data of the census.   For  each  of  these  2,000  OSS  packages  in  the  Census,  we  identified  the  raw  code 5 maintained on GitHub, the most widely used platform for hosting OSS.  We first attempted to 6 obtain the GitHub repository uniform resource locator (URL) for each package from libraries.io. We were able to match 1,657 packages to repositories via this initial method.  For URLs without 7 a  matching  repository,  we  performed  Google  searches  loosely  following  the  method  in  Singh (2020). More specifically, for each unmatched package, we used the Google API to search for the package name and 'GitHub Repository' and treated the first GitHub repository URL in the results as  its  best  matched  GitHub  URL.   This  resulted  in  an  additional  174  packages  matched  to  a 8 repository. Finally, we manually searched for URLs for the remaining 169 packages to identify the relevant repository. This entire process resulted in matching 1,840 out of the 2,000 Census packages to a code repository with the raw source code for the package. The unmatched packages were determined to have been either removed from GitHub or became proprietary (and thus the original source code was no longer available) and hence, the manual search allowed us to drop\n\n5 The packages that made up the remaining 30% of the full Census data in the long-tail usage distribution were not shared in the final report and therefore cannot be included in our analysis.\n\n6 GitHub  is  a  hosting  and  collaboration  platform  that  contributors  can  use  to  coordinate  the  development  and distribution of OSS projects. Founded in 2008, GitHub has become the largest hub for OSS development in the world. In January 2023, GitHub had more than 370 million repositories and over 100 million developers. In addition to personal users, a wide range of private firms actively use the GitHub platform, including Microsoft (which bought GitHub in 2018), Facebook, Google, and numerous other small and large firms.\n\n7 We attempted to access all repository URLs obtained as a sanity check to ensure they are in working condition. For those we could not access on GitHub, we manually found the correct URLs.\n\n8 As a robustness check, we randomly selected 50 package-repository matches derived from the Google Search method and we checked them by hand. All matches were manually confirmed to be correct providing additional support for the automated matching method.\n\nthese 160 unmatched packages (less than 8% of the Census sample of 2,000) with high confidence from our analysis.\n\nBuiltWith. The BuiltWith data contains scans of all public websites across the globe and identifies the technologies they use. Unlike the inward facing Census data which focus on the usage of OSS, the BuiltWith data scan for the use of both proprietary and OSS in firm websites without explicit differentiation. To separate OSS from proprietary software in BuiltWith, we turn to the subset of all open source web development software in the technology category that includes \"JavaScript and its libraries,\" which generates 778 observations corresponding to the NPM OSS category  in  the  Census  data.  There  are  two  reasons  for  this  sampling  choice.  First,  this  given category is constructed by BuiltWith and we use it as a proxy for OSS to separate it from pecuniary software.  Second,  JavaScript,  one  of  the  core  technologies  for  building  websites,  is  the  most popular programming language by usage on GitHub (GitHub, 2022) and thus enables us to capture the most important OSS from the demand side perspective. The scans include 8.8 million unique websites and 72.8 million corresponding observations of OSS usage from January 1 to November 16, 2020. Further, to ensure that we measure the value of OSS usage generated by the private sector,  we  match  the  adopting  domains  of  the  JavaScript-related  OSS  from  BuiltWith  with company websites recorded in Orbis, Compustat, and PitchBook, three commonly used databases of corporate activity that capture registered businesses across the world. Performing this match ensures that OSS used by non-commercial websites (e.g., an individual person's personal website) is excluded in our analysis. This results in a match-rate of 38.6%, which corresponds to around 3.4 million websites of distinct firms.\n\nFor the BuiltWith data, we cannot employ the first method we use for the Census (using libraries.io to help identify the repository URL) since only the technology names associated with the  packages  were  provided  by  BuiltWith,  and  other  information  (e.g.,  package  and  package manager  names)  is  not  included. 9 Hence,  we  start  by  performing  the  Google  Search  method mentioned above which results in a match of 695 packages to repositories. We then manually searched the Github URLs for 83 of the remaining unmatched packages, resulting in an addition of 46 packages. In total, for the BuiltWith data we were able to identify 741 out of 778 package-\n\n9 Since the package and package manager names are missing, a precise match using libraries.io was not feasible. Technology names are product names intended for customers and can be less technical and precise than the package names for internal development purposes. Thus, using technology names in a libraries.io search could cause significant ambiguity.\n\nrepository matches. As with the Census data, the remaining 37 unmatched packages (less than 5%) are dropped from our analysis because they had been deleted from GitHub.\n\nGHTorrent database. To obtain measures of the dispersion of the OSS value creation, we utilize  the  GHTorrent  database,  which  contains  the  entire  activity  history  on  GitHub  using GitHub's Representational State Transfer (REST) application programming interface (API). We leveraged  its  records  of  GitHub  repositories,  developer-level  commits,  and  developer  public profile information to estimate the contribution of each developer. We narrowed the sample for our developer contribution analysis in two steps. First, we winnowed the GitHub repositories and their  commits  from  GHTorrent  based  on  the  repository  URLs  of  our  joint  Census-BuiltWith sample. 10 Second, we focus on human contributions to OSS by removing approximately eight thousand (12%) GitHub contributors that we considered to be robots. 11 The final sample contains around sixty thousand developers and 2.3 million commits.\n\nTo prepare these three datasets for estimation, we first identified the number of lines of code and the programming languages used for each package using the OSS packages pygount (to count  the  number  of  lines  of  code)  and  linguist  (to  identify  programming  languages). 12 We categorize each distinct language into one of three different buckets moving from more likely human-written to more likely machine-written (see Table A1). Bucket 1 contains programming and markup languages (which are most likely to be human-written), bucket 3 contains data (most likely to be machine-written), and bucket 2 contains anything in between, such as config files and batch processing (which are sometimes human-written and sometimes machine-written, but it is difficult to tell based purely on looking at the code). 13 For our primary estimation we only use bucket 1 while providing robustness checks for buckets 2 and 3 in the Appendix, and thus our results represent a lower bound. Finally, for some analyses we dig deeper and show the top 5 programming languages (as classified by GitHub, 2022 for the year 2020; the year our data is from). The top 5 programming languages contain C (including C# and C++), Java, JavaScript,\n\n10 The match rate is over 96%, with the unmatched repositories accounting for only 0.15% of our calculated OSS demand value discussed below.\n\n11 The filtering is based on the 'fake user' classification by GHTorrent, as well as any usernames containing words 'bot' or 'robot', surrounded by special characters.

However, directly removing all OSS contributions from robot accounts is infeasible here, because we cannot observe the exact lines of code written by the robot accounts on GitHub.\n\nPython, and Typescript. We also add Go to this list of top languages since it is an increasingly widely used language in OSS.\n\nDocument 16: ## 5. Conclusion\n\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith. We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average value and distributed it across industries.\n\nIn this study we estimate the value of widely-used open source software globally with two unique datasets: the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data. We are able to estimate not only the supply side value of existing code (e.g., the cost it would take to rewrite each piece of widely-used OSS once) but also the demand side value for the private economy (e.g., the cost it would take for each company that uses a piece of OSS to rewrite it). While we do not focus on the long tail of OSS, we consider this an additional contribution of our study as focusing on OSS that is widely used allows us to more precisely understand the value created by OSS, rather than only measuring the  replacement  cost  for  all  OSS  (which  would  overestimate  the  true  value  since  many  OSS projects are not used in production code). However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n\nAdjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.  We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves.  Over  95%  percent  of  the  demand-side  value  is  generated  by  only  five  percent  of programmers, and those programmers contribute not only to a few widely used projects but to substantially more projects than the programmers that are engaged at the lower end of the value distribution.\n\nIn aggregate, our results show the substantial value that OSS contributes to the economy despite this value generally showing up as zero via direct measurement since prices equal zero and quantity is difficult to measure using public data alone. Our research lays the groundwork for future studies of not only OSS, but of all IT and its growing impact on the global economy.\n\nDocument 6: ## 1. Introduction\n\nIn 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that 'software is eating the world' (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that 'open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,' (Jacks, 2022). Other recent studies have come to similar conclusions showing that open source software  (OSS)  -  software  whose  source  code  is  publicly  available  for  inspection,  use,  and modification and is often created in a decentralized manner and distributed for free - appears in 96% of codebases (Synopsys 2023), and that some commercial software consists of up to 99.9% freely available OSS (Musseau et al., 2022). Although in its early days OSS frequently copied features from existing proprietary software, OSS today includes cutting edge technology in various fields including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, big data, and analytics.  However, despite the increasing importance of OSS to all software (and therefore to the entire economy), measuring its impact has been elusive. Traditionally, to measure the value created by a good or service,  economists  multiply  the  price  ( p )  times  the  quantity  sold  ( q ).  However,  in  OSS, p is generally zero since the source code is publicly available, and q is  unknown due to the limited number of restrictions around how the code may be copied and reused. For example, if a company downloads  a  piece  of  OSS  from  a  public  code  repository,  it  may  copy  it  thousands  of  times internally (legally) and then share it with suppliers or customers (also legally), so public download data is insufficient. Although some recent studies have sought to estimate the value of p (discussed below), data for estimating q has been unavailable or intractable for anything more than just a handful of OSS packages. Using newly collected data from multiple sources, the goal of this paper is to provide estimates for both p and q and to use those to shine light on the question: What is the value of open source software?\n\nUnderstanding the value of OSS is of critical importance not only due to the role it plays in the economy, but also due to it being one of the most successful and impactful modern examples of the centuries old economic concept of 'the commons' which run the risk of meeting the fate known as 'the tragedy of the commons.' This concept can trace its roots as far back as the 4 th -century BC philosopher Aristotle who wrote 'That which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care. Men pay most attention to what is their own and care less for what is common.'  (Aristotle,  1981).  William  Forster  Lloyd  (1833)  resurfaced  the  idea  in  modern economic thought by highlighting the example of shared tracts of land used for cattle grazing by\n\nmultiple cattle herders who each had an incentive to overuse the shared resource. Garrett Hardin (1968)  brought  the  concept  into  the  broader  zeitgeist  when  he  wrote  an  article  discussing  the problem entitled 'The Tragedy of the Commons.' Building on this work, Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for her research highlighting paths to avoiding the tragedy of the commons through community coordination efforts that did not necessitate government enforced laws to manage and guard the commons (Ostrom 1990). The parallels between shared grazing lands and shared digital infrastructure are palpable - the availability of communal grass to feed cattle, and in turn feed people, was critical to the agrarian economy, and the ability to not have to recreate code that someone else has already written is critical to the modern economy. Further, in both contexts, despite knowing grass and code are critical inputs to the economy, measuring their actual value is difficult. And, as the renowned mathematician and physicist Lord Kelvin is believed to have said, 'If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.' And if you cannot improve and maintain it, such common goods may crumble under the weight of their own success as they are overused, but underinvested in (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021). Therefore, measuring the value OSS creates is crucial to the future health of the digital economy, and the rest of the economy that is built on top of it.\n\nImportantly, recent studies have attempted to address these measurement issues but fall short of capturing both the breadth and depth of OSS usage - a gap we seek to fill with this paper. For example, researchers have attempted to gain breadth by using novel methodologies to estimate the labor replacement value of the current corpus of OSS created in the United States at $38 billion in 2019 (Robbins et al., 2021) and that created in the European Union at €1 billion (Blind et al., 2021) by imputing the labor costs that it would have taken to rewrite existing OSS. Such efforts do a very good job at estimating what it would cost to replace all existing OSS if it disappeared tomorrow. However, the resultant estimates rely on two important assumptions. First, that all OSS is equally valuable from a usage standpoint, and second that the concept of OSS would still exist, and society would just need to rewrite the code once, thus addressing the aforementioned problem of a missing value for p , but not addressing the missing value of q . In a world where OSS did not exist at all, then each piece of OSS software would not need to be rewritten just once, but instead would need to be rewritten by every firm that used the software (assuming the firm could freely share the software within its boundaries). Other research (Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; MurcianoGoroff, Zhuo, and Greenstein, 2021) has gone deeper into this hypothetical, albeit in a narrow\n\nmanner, by only focusing on web servers (which are public facing on the Internet and can therefore be readily measured). Using different methods, both studies measure q for this one type of software and impute p by using a goods replacement value approach based on the prices for closed-source alternatives offered by firms. With data from the United States the resulting estimates show a value of  $2  billion  for  the  OSS  Apache  Web  Server  in  2012  (Greenstein  and  Nagle,  2014)  and  a combined value of $4.5 billion for Apache and the increasingly popular OSS web server nginx in 2018 (Murciano-Goroff, et al., 2021). However, although web servers are an important part of the OSS  ecosystem,  they  constitute  a  small  portion  of  it.  We  seek  to  build  upon  the  important contributions this existing research has made in an attempt to go both broad and deep to create a more complete measure of the value of OSS.\n\nTo consider the value of OSS in both a broad and deep manner, we use data from two primary sources that allow us to gain insights into the OSS used at tens of thousands of firms across the world. The first is the 'Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries' (Nagle et al., 2022). The Census II project utilized partnerships with multiple software composition analysis (SCA) firms to create various lists of the most widely used OSS. SCAs are hired to scan the codebases of a company to ensure they are not violating any OSS licenses and, as a byproduct, track all the OSS code used by their customers and the products they build. The Census II project aggregated data from multiple SCAs to build a dataset of OSS usage at tens of thousands of firms based  on  millions  of  data  points  (observations  of  OSS  usage).  The  second  data  source  is  the BuiltWith dataset, from which we leverage scans of nearly nine million websites to identify the underlying technology deployed by these websites, including OSS libraries. The BuiltWith data has been used in multiple academic studies (DeStefano &amp; Timmis 2023, Dushnitsky &amp; Stroube 2021, Koning et al.. 2022), but to our knowledge this is the first one to focus on OSS usage. The Census II data and the BuiltWith data are complementary as the former focuses on OSS that is built  into  the  software  a  company  sells,  while  the  latter  focuses  on  OSS  that  is  built  into  a company's website, thus reducing the chances of double-counting observations across the datasets. In aggregate, these two datasets combined create the most complete measurement of OSS usage ( q ) to date. Further, by focusing on OSS that is widely deployed and used by firms, rather than considering all the projects that exist in an OSS repository, we enhance the methodologies of prior studies by reducing the likelihood of measurement error stemming from projects that are posted as publicly available OSS but are not actually used in any practical manner. Not accounting for this\n\nmeasurement error would lead to overestimation of the actual value of OSS as projects that are widely used would be valued in the same way as projects that are not used at all.\n\nTo estimate p ,  we  follow  the  literature  discussed  above  and  use  the  labor  replacement value. First, we calculate the labor cost it would take an individual firm to recreate a given OSS package by measuring the number of lines of code within the package and then applying the Constructive Cost Model II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) - also known as COCOMO II to estimate the number of person-hours it would take to write the code from scratch. We then utilize global wage data from Salary Expert to get an accurate estimate of the labor costs a firm would incur if this piece of OSS did not exist. These costs can be combined with the q values from above at the OSS package level to estimate the combined value of all OSS from both the supply and demand sides.\n\nWe find a value ranging from $1.22 billion to $6.22 billion if we were to decide as a society to recreate all widely used OSS on the supply side. However, considering the actual usage of OSS leads to a demand-side value that is orders of magnitude larger and ranges from $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion, if each firm who used an OSS package had to recreate it from scratch (e.g., the concept of OSS did not exist). We document substantial heterogeneity of the value of OSS by programming  language  and  internal  vs  outward-facing  programming  efforts.  Further,  we  find considerable  heterogeneity  in  value  contributions  by  programmers  as  5%  of  programmers  are responsible for more than 90% of the value created on the supply- and demand- side. The data we use is arguably the most comprehensive source of data to measure the value created by firm usage of OSS at this time. However, as for any project, the evidence is not complete and we argue that we underestimate the value since our data, e.g., does not include operating systems, which are a substantial omitted category of OSS.\n\nThis study makes four important contributions to the academic literature, practitioners, and policy makers. First, it provides the most complete estimate of the value of widely used OSS to date  by  accounting  for  not  only  the  supply-side  of  OSS  (price  to  create  it),  but  also  for  the usage\/demand-side at a scale that has not been done before. While prior estimates of the value of OSS only went either broad (estimating the supply-side costs of a large swath of OSS) or deep (estimating the value created by one particular type of OSS), this study does both by using unique datasets that allow for a better understanding of the breadth and depth of OSS usage. Further, rather than measuring the value of all OSS, this study focuses on the value of OSS that is used by firms\n\nto create its products and websites, limiting the measurement error occurring in studies that are unable to account for which OSS is actually used in production. This contribution builds upon, and extends, important research (e.g., Blind et al., 2021; Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021; Robbins et al., 2021) that has sought to identify the value of this vital resource that contributes a great deal to the modern economy despite the difficulties measuring this contribution. In  doing  so,  it  adds  insights  to  a  long-running  discussion  related  to  the  impact  of  information technology (IT) on productivity (Brynjolfsson, 1993; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 1996; Nagle, 2019a; Solow, 1987) known as the 'productivity paradox' where IT investments can have limited impact on productivity statistics. This debate has continued into the emerging context of AI (Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson, 2018). Our work contributes to this conversation by highlighting a massive societal level cost-savings (and hence productivity enhancement) that is created by the existence of OSS.\n\nSecond, our research contributes methodological advances to the study of intangible capital by highlighting novel sources of data related to investments in OSS. Prior research has shown that intangible capital plays an increasingly important role in economic growth (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel,  2009)  and  firm  value  (Peters  and  Taylor,  2017),  but  it  often  goes  unmeasured  or misattributed (Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou, 2014). Further, we demonstrate how these data sources can be used to understand the true investments in software that a firm makes, and that which they would have to make if OSS did not exist.  This  is  valuable  as  investments  in  software  are  an increasingly important type of intangible capital that is driving innovation (Branstetter, Drev, and Kwon, 2019) and performance (Krishnan et al., 2000).\n\nThird, our results help highlight for firms and managers the importance of OSS to their production, and ideally add weight to arguments that users of OSS should not just free ride but also contribute to the creation and maintenance of OSS (e.g., Henkel, 2008; Nagle, 2018). Such contributions are a fraction of the costs that firms would incur if OSS did not exist and the active participation of OSS users in helping maintain the OSS they use is critical to the health and future well-being of the OSS ecosystem (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021; Zhang et al., 2019).\n\nFourth,  and  finally,  our  study  helps  inform  policymakers  who  have  recently  started  to understand  the  growing  importance  of  OSS  to  the  economy  and  taken  actions  to  support  the ecosystem (European Commission, 2020; Executive Order No. 14028, 2021). However, most of these efforts are related to securing the existing OSS ecosystem, which is quite important, but do\n\nnot go as far as supporting the creation of new OSS. Our results help shine light on the importance of OSS to the overall economy and add weight to calls for more societal support of this critical resource. Our results further show that the majority of the value created by OSS is created by a small  number  of  contributors.  Although  it  has  long  been  known  that  a  small  number  of  OSS contributors do most of the work, we add new insights that show this is even more true for the value creation of widely-used OSS projects and that societal support for these individuals is critical to the future success of OSS, and in turn, the economy.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Introduction\n\nIn 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that 'software is eating the world' (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that 'open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,' (Jacks, 2022). Other recent studies have come to similar conclusions showing that open source software  (OSS)  -  software  whose  source  code  is  publicly  available  for  inspection,  use,  and modification and is often created in a decentralized manner and distributed for free - appears in 96% of codebases (Synopsys 2023), and that some commercial software consists of up to 99.9% freely available OSS (Musseau et al., 2022). Although in its early days OSS frequently copied features from existing proprietary software, OSS today includes cutting edge technology in various fields including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, big data, and analytics.  However, despite the increasing importance of OSS to all software (and therefore to the entire economy), measuring its impact has been elusive. Traditionally, to measure the value created by a good or service,  economists  multiply  the  price  ( p )  times  the  quantity  sold  ( q ).  However,  in  OSS, p is generally zero since the source code is publicly available, and q is  unknown due to the limited number of restrictions around how the code may be copied and reused. For example, if a company downloads  a  piece  of  OSS  from  a  public  code  repository,  it  may  copy  it  thousands  of  times internally (legally) and then share it with suppliers or customers (also legally), so public download data is insufficient. Although some recent studies have sought to estimate the value of p (discussed below), data for estimating q has been unavailable or intractable for anything more than just a handful of OSS packages. Using newly collected data from multiple sources, the goal of this paper is to provide estimates for both p and q and to use those to shine light on the question: What is the value of open source software?\n\nUnderstanding the value of OSS is of critical importance not only due to the role it plays in the economy, but also due to it being one of the most successful and impactful modern examples of the centuries old economic concept of 'the commons' which run the risk of meeting the fate known as 'the tragedy of the commons.' This concept can trace its roots as far back as the 4 th -century BC philosopher Aristotle who wrote 'That which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care. Men pay most attention to what is their own and care less for what is common.'  (Aristotle,  1981).  William  Forster  Lloyd  (1833)  resurfaced  the  idea  in  modern economic thought by highlighting the example of shared tracts of land used for cattle grazing by\n\nmultiple cattle herders who each had an incentive to overuse the shared resource. Garrett Hardin (1968)  brought  the  concept  into  the  broader  zeitgeist  when  he  wrote  an  article  discussing  the problem entitled 'The Tragedy of the Commons.' Building on this work, Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for her research highlighting paths to avoiding the tragedy of the commons through community coordination efforts that did not necessitate government enforced laws to manage and guard the commons (Ostrom 1990). The parallels between shared grazing lands and shared digital infrastructure are palpable - the availability of communal grass to feed cattle, and in turn feed people, was critical to the agrarian economy, and the ability to not have to recreate code that someone else has already written is critical to the modern economy. Further, in both contexts, despite knowing grass and code are critical inputs to the economy, measuring their actual value is difficult. And, as the renowned mathematician and physicist Lord Kelvin is believed to have said, 'If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.' And if you cannot improve and maintain it, such common goods may crumble under the weight of their own success as they are overused, but underinvested in (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021). Therefore, measuring the value OSS creates is crucial to the future health of the digital economy, and the rest of the economy that is built on top of it.\n\nImportantly, recent studies have attempted to address these measurement issues but fall short of capturing both the breadth and depth of OSS usage - a gap we seek to fill with this paper. For example, researchers have attempted to gain breadth by using novel methodologies to estimate the labor replacement value of the current corpus of OSS created in the United States at $38 billion in 2019 (Robbins et al., 2021) and that created in the European Union at €1 billion (Blind et al., 2021) by imputing the labor costs that it would have taken to rewrite existing OSS. Such efforts do a very good job at estimating what it would cost to replace all existing OSS if it disappeared tomorrow. However, the resultant estimates rely on two important assumptions. First, that all OSS is equally valuable from a usage standpoint, and second that the concept of OSS would still exist, and society would just need to rewrite the code once, thus addressing the aforementioned problem of a missing value for p , but not addressing the missing value of q . In a world where OSS did not exist at all, then each piece of OSS software would not need to be rewritten just once, but instead would need to be rewritten by every firm that used the software (assuming the firm could freely share the software within its boundaries). Other research (Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; MurcianoGoroff, Zhuo, and Greenstein, 2021) has gone deeper into this hypothetical, albeit in a narrow\n\nmanner, by only focusing on web servers (which are public facing on the Internet and can therefore be readily measured). Using different methods, both studies measure q for this one type of software and impute p by using a goods replacement value approach based on the prices for closed-source alternatives offered by firms. With data from the United States the resulting estimates show a value of  $2  billion  for  the  OSS  Apache  Web  Server  in  2012  (Greenstein  and  Nagle,  2014)  and  a combined value of $4.5 billion for Apache and the increasingly popular OSS web server nginx in 2018 (Murciano-Goroff, et al., 2021). However, although web servers are an important part of the OSS  ecosystem,  they  constitute  a  small  portion  of  it.  We  seek  to  build  upon  the  important contributions this existing research has made in an attempt to go both broad and deep to create a more complete measure of the value of OSS.\n\nTo consider the value of OSS in both a broad and deep manner, we use data from two primary sources that allow us to gain insights into the OSS used at tens of thousands of firms across the world. The first is the 'Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries' (Nagle et al., 2022). The Census II project utilized partnerships with multiple software composition analysis (SCA) firms to create various lists of the most widely used OSS. SCAs are hired to scan the codebases of a company to ensure they are not violating any OSS licenses and, as a byproduct, track all the OSS code used by their customers and the products they build. The Census II project aggregated data from multiple SCAs to build a dataset of OSS usage at tens of thousands of firms based  on  millions  of  data  points  (observations  of  OSS  usage).  The  second  data  source  is  the BuiltWith dataset, from which we leverage scans of nearly nine million websites to identify the underlying technology deployed by these websites, including OSS libraries. The BuiltWith data has been used in multiple academic studies (DeStefano &amp; Timmis 2023, Dushnitsky &amp; Stroube 2021, Koning et al.. 2022), but to our knowledge this is the first one to focus on OSS usage. The Census II data and the BuiltWith data are complementary as the former focuses on OSS that is built  into  the  software  a  company  sells,  while  the  latter  focuses  on  OSS  that  is  built  into  a company's website, thus reducing the chances of double-counting observations across the datasets. In aggregate, these two datasets combined create the most complete measurement of OSS usage ( q ) to date. Further, by focusing on OSS that is widely deployed and used by firms, rather than considering all the projects that exist in an OSS repository, we enhance the methodologies of prior studies by reducing the likelihood of measurement error stemming from projects that are posted as publicly available OSS but are not actually used in any practical manner. Not accounting for this\n\nmeasurement error would lead to overestimation of the actual value of OSS as projects that are widely used would be valued in the same way as projects that are not used at all.\n\nTo estimate p ,  we  follow  the  literature  discussed  above  and  use  the  labor  replacement value. First, we calculate the labor cost it would take an individual firm to recreate a given OSS package by measuring the number of lines of code within the package and then applying the Constructive Cost Model II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) - also known as COCOMO II to estimate the number of person-hours it would take to write the code from scratch. We then utilize global wage data from Salary Expert to get an accurate estimate of the labor costs a firm would incur if this piece of OSS did not exist. These costs can be combined with the q values from above at the OSS package level to estimate the combined value of all OSS from both the supply and demand sides.\n\nWe find a value ranging from $1.22 billion to $6.22 billion if we were to decide as a society to recreate all widely used OSS on the supply side. However, considering the actual usage of OSS leads to a demand-side value that is orders of magnitude larger and ranges from $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion, if each firm who used an OSS package had to recreate it from scratch (e.g., the concept of OSS did not exist). We document substantial heterogeneity of the value of OSS by programming  language  and  internal  vs  outward-facing  programming  efforts.  Further,  we  find considerable  heterogeneity  in  value  contributions  by  programmers  as  5%  of  programmers  are responsible for more than 90% of the value created on the supply- and demand- side. The data we use is arguably the most comprehensive source of data to measure the value created by firm usage of OSS at this time. However, as for any project, the evidence is not complete and we argue that we underestimate the value since our data, e.g., does not include operating systems, which are a substantial omitted category of OSS.\n\nThis study makes four important contributions to the academic literature, practitioners, and policy makers. First, it provides the most complete estimate of the value of widely used OSS to date  by  accounting  for  not  only  the  supply-side  of  OSS  (price  to  create  it),  but  also  for  the usage\/demand-side at a scale that has not been done before. While prior estimates of the value of OSS only went either broad (estimating the supply-side costs of a large swath of OSS) or deep (estimating the value created by one particular type of OSS), this study does both by using unique datasets that allow for a better understanding of the breadth and depth of OSS usage. Further, rather than measuring the value of all OSS, this study focuses on the value of OSS that is used by firms\n\nto create its products and websites, limiting the measurement error occurring in studies that are unable to account for which OSS is actually used in production. This contribution builds upon, and extends, important research (e.g., Blind et al., 2021; Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021; Robbins et al., 2021) that has sought to identify the value of this vital resource that contributes a great deal to the modern economy despite the difficulties measuring this contribution. In  doing  so,  it  adds  insights  to  a  long-running  discussion  related  to  the  impact  of  information technology (IT) on productivity (Brynjolfsson, 1993; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 1996; Nagle, 2019a; Solow, 1987) known as the 'productivity paradox' where IT investments can have limited impact on productivity statistics. This debate has continued into the emerging context of AI (Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson, 2018). Our work contributes to this conversation by highlighting a massive societal level cost-savings (and hence productivity enhancement) that is created by the existence of OSS.\n\nSecond, our research contributes methodological advances to the study of intangible capital by highlighting novel sources of data related to investments in OSS. Prior research has shown that intangible capital plays an increasingly important role in economic growth (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel,  2009)  and  firm  value  (Peters  and  Taylor,  2017),  but  it  often  goes  unmeasured  or misattributed (Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou, 2014). Further, we demonstrate how these data sources can be used to understand the true investments in software that a firm makes, and that which they would have to make if OSS did not exist.  This  is  valuable  as  investments  in  software  are  an increasingly important type of intangible capital that is driving innovation (Branstetter, Drev, and Kwon, 2019) and performance (Krishnan et al., 2000).\n\nThird, our results help highlight for firms and managers the importance of OSS to their production, and ideally add weight to arguments that users of OSS should not just free ride but also contribute to the creation and maintenance of OSS (e.g., Henkel, 2008; Nagle, 2018). Such contributions are a fraction of the costs that firms would incur if OSS did not exist and the active participation of OSS users in helping maintain the OSS they use is critical to the health and future well-being of the OSS ecosystem (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021; Zhang et al., 2019).\n\nFourth,  and  finally,  our  study  helps  inform  policymakers  who  have  recently  started  to understand  the  growing  importance  of  OSS  to  the  economy  and  taken  actions  to  support  the ecosystem (European Commission, 2020; Executive Order No. 14028, 2021). However, most of these efforts are related to securing the existing OSS ecosystem, which is quite important, but do\n\nnot go as far as supporting the creation of new OSS. Our results help shine light on the importance of OSS to the overall economy and add weight to calls for more societal support of this critical resource. Our results further show that the majority of the value created by OSS is created by a small  number  of  contributors.  Although  it  has  long  been  known  that  a  small  number  of  OSS contributors do most of the work, we add new insights that show this is even more true for the value creation of widely-used OSS projects and that societal support for these individuals is critical to the future success of OSS, and in turn, the economy.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

In the first step, we measure the value contributions by developers. In a second step, we obtain a measure for the number of repositories developers contribute to. Finally, we provide a graphical representation of both using the commonly known concept of the Lorenz curve to better understand the extent of inequality in contributions. We describe the details below.\n\nValue Contribution. We calculated the supply and demand values of OSS that each developer contributed. At the repository level, we quantified each developer's proportional work contribution by calculating their share of commits to the total number of commits for a repository. This share was subsequently multiplied with the repository's demand and supply values separately to derive\n\n17 There are 179 counties in Wachs et al. (2022), but the top 30 countries consist of over 88% of the global active contributors with each of the rest having less than 0.6% share. The top 30 countries are listed in Table A2.\n\n18 We choose the high- and low-wage reference countries based on a combination of the number of active GitHub developers and the average annual software developer base wage.\n\nthe value-added contribution of that individual contributor to the repository. Finally, we aggregate the value contributions across all repositories for each developer. The individual value contribution from a unique developer Dev , 𝑉 -+.\/ , can be expressed as:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere 𝜎 ( +.\/ is the share of commits the focal developer made in repository  , and i 𝑉 (-is the demand or supply value of the entire repository   specified in Equations (1) and (2), with i 𝑗 ∈ {𝐷, 𝑆} , and N is the number of repositories in our main sample, i.e. Census and BuiltWith combined.\n\nRepository  Contribution. This  is  simply  the  number  of  repositories  a  given  developer contributes to, and it is expressed as follows:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere   is the indicator function equal to 1 when the developer has a non-zero number of commits 𝟙 to  repository i .  This  measure  entails  the  variety  of  OSS  needs  being  addressed  by  individual developers. Jointly with the value contribution measure, they help us understand whether the value that is being generated overall is concentrated within a small number of developers. It may be generally more desirable for the whole OSS ecosystem and its diversity if individual developers participate in many repositories and not just a few.\n\nMeasuring  the  Dispersion  of  Contributions . To  graphically  examine  the  dispersion  of developer contribution values, we utilized Lorenz curves (Lorenz, 1905), with respect to both demand and supply side values. Lorenz curves are a well-established way to represent inequality and, as such, they allow us to better understand how dispersed developer contributions to OSS within the private economy are. Developers are systematically arranged in ascending order based on their contributions to OSS demand and supply, as delineated in Equation (7). Subsequently, these ranks were normalized to a scale ranging from 0 to 100 percentiles, serving as the x-axis values for the Lorenz Curves. The y-axis, on the other hand, presents the corresponding value contributions 𝑉 -+.\/ . The graphical representation in the results section will elucidate the degree of inequality pertaining to the value contributions among developers. To supplement the analysis, we\n\nfurther investigated how dispersed the repository contribution, 𝑁 +.\/ , is by plotting Equation (8). This enables us to ascertain whether any substantial value inequality stems from top contributors predominantly focusing on a narrow subset of exceptionally popular repositories, or alternatively, from their engagement with a broader spectrum of successful repositories.","conversation_history":[{"role":"user","content":"I am interested in the method used to graphically examine the dispersion of developer contribution values in the Harvard Business School's OSS report."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How can I help you with that?"}],"metadata":{"question_type":"conversational","seed_document_id":10,"topic":"Others"}}
{"id":"d056db6c-184e-4f7e-a0b1-7a67c1b70a9e","question":"What is used to determine that?","reference_answer":"The methodology used to estimate the value of OSS involves a labor market approach, where the labor replacement cost of each OSS package is calculated using COCOMO II. This involves estimating the cost to reproduce the package by hiring programmers and paying them a competitive market wage. The supply-side value is then scaled by the usage of each package to obtain a demand-side value. Additionally, an alternative goods-market valuation approach is mentioned, which considers the costs if all commercial users of free OSS had to replace it with pecuniary alternatives.","reference_context":"Document 8: ## 3. Methodology\n\nWe first measure the value of OSS by considering the supply and the demand side of OSS using a labor market approach. 14 The thought experiment is that we live in a world where OSS does not exist and has to be recreated at each firm that uses a given piece of OSS. Using the labor market approach, we calculate the labor replacement cost of each OSS package. To estimate the value for each package, we use COCOMO II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) at the individual package level and then sum across all package values to obtain a supply-side labor market replacement value. Then, we scale the supply-side value by the number of times firms are using each package while removing multi-usage within each firm to obtain a demand-side value.\n\nSecond, we move beyond the aggregate and inspect inequality in the value creation process. In OSS, as with many creative endeavors, it is common that a small handful of individuals provide the bulk of the contributions, while many others make small contributions (sometimes referred to as the 80\/20 rule, implying 80% of the work is done by 20% of the people). Research has shown these frequent contributors often attain positions of influence in OSS communities as a result of their efforts (Hanisch, et al, 2018). Therefore, to better understand the dispersion of value creation across developers, we first use the GHTorrent data and identify individual developer contributions in two ways: a) through their OSS value contributions directly and b) through the total number of repositories they contributed to. We then test how concentrated these two contribution measures are to better understand whether many or few developers contribute to the total value we measure. We explain the exact details for the labor market approach and the inequality of valuations below.\n\nDocument 9: ## 3.1 Labor market approach\n\nFor the labor market approach, we estimate the value of OSS by calculating the replacement value of a package. We ask how much it would cost to reproduce the package by hiring a programmer and paying them a competitive market wage. To estimate this supply-side value ( 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; ) , we take the complete list of OSS packages discussed above, and then count the lines of code in each unique\n\n14 In an alternative version, we use a mixture of a labor and goods market approach that is more closely aligned with Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff, et al (2021). However, applying this method in our setting requires numerous additional assumptions due to data constraints. For simplicity we call it the goods market approach for which we provide the details and statistics, as well as the limitations in Appendix A.\n\npackage. 15 For each unique package,  , we calculate the value and then sum over all these values i to obtain the total value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nIn this calculation, we implicitly do not incorporate any production externalities since we assume that there is no spillover knowledge from one package to the next that would lower the cost of programming. 16 This methodology is similar to that used by other papers that estimate the supply-side costs of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021).\n\nWe then calculate the demand-side value of OSS by incorporating the usage information ( Q) for each package:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nHere, we do not incorporate consumption externalities, i.e., we do not allow a benefit to arise for the general public when a package has been created and we further make sure that each firm is only replacing a package they use once, since a replaced package can be used within a firm as a club good (e.g., see Cornes and Sandler, 1996). The value 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost to rewrite all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the concept of OSS still exists, but all of these packages needed to be rewritten from scratch), while the value 𝑉 + \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost for each firm that uses one of these OSS packages to pay a developer to rewrite those packages (e.g., OSS itself no longer exists).\n\nFor both the supply and demand models, we obtain the dollar-value for each package ( 𝑃 ( ) via the Constructive Cost Model II, also abbreviated as COCOMO II (Boehm 1984, Boehm et al. 2009). The model has previously been used by the United States Department of Defense to estimate software project costs as well as in prior research estimating the value of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021). It is a highly flexible model that allows us to create non-linear transformations of lines of code to dollar-values. It uses the following modelling equation:\n\n15 We use only the pure lines of code excluding documentation lines and empty lines. Hence, we underestimate the true value of recreating each package.\n\n16 Similar to a representative agent model (e.g. see Williamson 2006), one may think of each package being reproduced by separate programmers who are identical replicas of each other (and therefore have the same skill level, but do not become more efficient via learning).\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n( (\n\nwhere 𝐿 represents the lines of codes in thousands and E the effort in person-month units for each project  . Consistent with Blind et al. (2021), we use the default parameter values for i 𝛼 , 𝛽 and 𝜂. The parameters 𝛼 𝛽 , are non-linear adjustment factors set to 2.94, and 1.0997 respectively . The parameter 𝜂 is an effort-adjustment factor which can be modified to incorporate subjective assessments of product, hardware, personnel, and project attributes. Since we do not have a prior for each project, we set 𝜂 to the default value of one. To obtain the price ( 𝑃 ( ) of each OSS project, we  then  multiply  the  results  of  equation  (3)  by  the  weighted  global  wage  that  an  average programmer would obtain on the open market. To calculate a global wage, we include the base monthly salaries of software developers from Salary Expert for the top 30 countries in terms of their GitHub developer counts in 2021 (Wachs et al., 2022). 17 The weight of each country is its share of active GitHub contributors over the total contributors in the top 30 countries. We further create bounds by using a low-wage (India) and high-wage (USA) labor market for the wage to better understand how the value would vary by the pool of programmers used to recreate all of OSS. 18\n\nDocument 11: ## 4. Results\n\nAfter applying the labor market approach using COCOMO II, we obtain global estimates for the value of OSS. To calculate the overall value, we first need the underlying number of lines of code (to calculate the supply-side value) and then the usage statistics (for the demand-side value). Since there may be substantial heterogeneity in value by programming languages, we also show the top programming languages during our investigation period in the year 2020, as discussed above.\n\nDocument 21: ## Appendix A) Goods-Market Valuation Approach\n\nAs an alternate estimation method, instead of using the labor replacement cost, we use a goods replacement value approach. We identify several OSS packages that have similar closed-source, pecuniary alternatives and consider the costs if all commercial users of the free OSS had to replace that software with a pecuniary alternative (similar to the calculations Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) performed for web servers). We can then use this alternate value of p , combined with the q values from above to estimate a goods replacement value of OSS. This method builds on suggestions from Nordhaus (2006, p. 146) who says '…the price of market and nonmarket goods and services should be imputed on the basis of the comparable market goods and services.' We do not expect the estimates from the two methods to be similar. Quite the contrary, the value of those two methods varies substantially since the latter goods-market approach assumes a fixed price to sell a good multiple times and that fixed price is usually lower than the total value estimated from recreating all packages on the labor side. The differential between these estimates is  essentially the result of a firm stepping in to reproduce the missing OSS packages and then selling them for a pecuniary price rather than all firms needing to reproduce those packages from scratch themselves.\n\nWith the goods market approach, the thought experiment is still that we live in a world where OSS does not exist, but it has to be recreated via one firm that then charges a price for a good that is currently free. To value OSS via the goods market approach, we created a basket of equivalent substitute proprietary goods that are priced on the open market as a stand-in for an OSS product.  This  methodology  is  consistent  with  that  used  in  the  prior  literature  (Greenstein  and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021) although both of those studies only used a single good rather than a basket since they were focused on only one type of OSS (web servers). Since there is no readily available database for proprietary equivalents of OSS, we conduct a search based on subjective  perception  of  popularity  of  OSS  and  we  then  search  for  pecuniary,  closed-source substitutes for them. The resulting basket of 20 OSS packages with proprietary substitutes is a good representation of the diversity of OSS. The software ranges from media and design software to statistical analysis programs, to database management and web server software. 21\n\n21 Table A5 shows the basket of OSS and their proprietary equivalents that we used. To create this basket, we looked for proprietary software that had an OSS equivalent that was similar in its overall function and feature set, and sought to identify pairs of software that, in aggregate, captured a broad and representative set of the types of OSS that exist.\n\nBased on our OSS equivalent substitute proprietary goods basket we then obtain prices for each proprietary software equivalent and we calculated the COCOMO labor market supply-side value for each OSS product in the basket which we use as a proxy - for lack of the code from the proprietary software - for the COCOMO labor supply side value of the proprietary software (e.g., the cost it would take to pay a programmer to write that proprietary software from scratch). We then calculate the average COCOMO labor supply-side value of the basket, 𝑉 !,1#23.4 ,  and  the average price for the basket, 𝑃 !,1#23.4 . 22 Since, we know the labor market supply-side value of all OSS, 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; , we can setup the following equation and obtain the price of OSS, 𝑃 ! for the goodsmarket for all OSS via a simple scaling transformation:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nThis results in the following goods-market supply-side value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nWe can then obtain the equivalent demand-side goods-market values as follows:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nFrom the goods market side, we consider the equivalent price that a firm would charge if it produced all existing widely used OSS and then sold it as a product to customers.\n\nTable A6, column 3 shows that the value on the demand side ranges between $177 million and $244 million across the different buckets independent of the country of origin from which programmers are hired. Naturally, the goods-market value will be substantially smaller than the labor demand value since this imaginary firm will make a profit at a comparatively low price by producing the software once and then selling it to many customers. Further, while Greenstein and Nagle (2014) as well as Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) focus on one particular type of software only (web servers), we attempt to expand on their approach to many goods. However, the data limitations become a stronger constraint in this context which makes it inherently more difficult\n\n22 We obtained the average price of the goods-market proprietary basket by using a 3 years lifespan of software, i.e. 1\/(1-0.66), so the depreciation factor is 0.33. This is consistent with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules for depreciating software, which states 'If you can depreciate the cost of computer software, use the straight line method over a useful life of 36 months.' https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/publications\/p946#en\\_US\\_2022\\_publink1000107354.\n\nto  estimate  the  value  through  this  approach  while  requiring  substantially  more  assumptions. Instead of a pure goods-market approach, this requires assistance from the labor-market approach in terms of scaling for the estimate, which ultimately leads to a substantial underestimate of the value of OSS. Further, the pricing strategy of the proprietary software counterparts is sensitive to the  market  demand.  With  the  goods-market  approach  extending  to  multiple  goods,  the  strong implicit assumption is that the market demands for our basket software and our sample OSS are similar, so they lead to commensurate prices.\n\nAn alternative and even more simplified goods-market back-of-the-envelope calculation that does not account for lines of code and relies on no scaling from the labor market approach would simply be to multiply a price of a reference good with the usage. We can take the minimum, average, and maximum prices of the basket of proprietary goods as captured in the reference price vector p = (69.99, 1610.17, 5800) and simply multiply it with usage from the combined Census and BuiltWith sample (Table 1). Based on those imputed proprietary price assumptions, the goods market demand side value would range from $0.2 - $16.5 trillion (minimum price - maximum price)  with  the  mean  price  resulting  in  a  value  estimate  of  $4.5  trillion.  However,  while  this estimate creates slightly more variance than the labor market approach, it is inherently flawed by simply assuming that the imputed prices are identical for each open source product based on the reference price. We further think this very simple back-of-the-envelope is an orange to apples comparison since the goods in our basket are fully functional, stand-alone software packages, while the packages in the Census and BuiltWith datasets are comprised of application libraries, which are generally smaller than such stand-alone packages.\n\nGiven all the complexities and assumptions one has to make due to lack of data for a goodsmarket approach, we place stronger emphasis on the labor cost approach highlighted in the main body but we include this method here for completeness.","conversation_history":[{"role":"user","content":"The Harvard Business School's OSS report estimates the value of OSS using a specific methodology."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How can I help you with that?"}],"metadata":{"question_type":"conversational","seed_document_id":8,"topic":"Others"}}

The  inward-facing Census  (Panel  A)  contains  just  over  261.7  million  lines  of  code  with  72%  of  the  lines  being attributable to the top programming languages. The average package includes 142 thousand lines of code with a slightly lower average of 113 thousand lines of code for the subset of top languages. When considering the demand (usage) side, we observe that the Census packages were used over 2.7 million times while 92% of this usage is attributable to the top languages. The average package was used 1,472.4 times with a higher usage of around 1,497.5 for the top  languages.  For  the outward-facing  BuiltWith  data  we  find  similar  patterns,  but  at  different  levels.  The  packages included from BuiltWith include over 82 million lines of code, 71% of which are attributable to the  top  programming  languages.  The  average  package  within  the  BuiltWith  sample  has  111 thousand  lines  of  code  with  a  lower  average  of  around  80  thousand  lines  of  code  for  the  top languages. This is because our BuiltWith data primarily consists of JavaScript-based packages, which are often smaller than packages written in other languages. BuiltWith packages were used over 142 thousand times where 99.97% were attributable to the top languages. Next, we used these raw observations to calculate the value of all OSS through the labor market approach and estimated the value created from the supply and demand side.\n\n--- Table 2 about here ---\n\nTable 2 shows the estimates for the value of OSS based on the firm-relevant joint Census and BuiltWith sample. All estimates in Table 2 are based only on software languages classified in bucket  1  from  Table  A1,  which  are  the  most  likely  to  be  written  by  a  human  rather  than  a machine. 19 The first column contains estimates with wages from a low income country (India), the global  average  wage,  and  a  high  income  country  (United  States  of  America),  respectively  (as described above). To reproduce all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the idea of OSS still exists, but all current OSS is deleted and needs to be coded from scratch), using programmers at the average developer wage from India, it would require an investment of $1.22 billion. In contrast, if we use the average developer wage from the United States, then reproducing all widely-used OSS would require  an  investment  of  $6.22  billion.  Using  a  pool  of  programmers  from  across  the  world, weighed based on the existing geographic contributions to OSS as discussed above, would lead to an investment somewhere in between the low and high-income country, $4.15 billion. It is useful to compare these numbers to those from similar studies to understand differences in valuing all OSS (prior studies) versus that which is widely used (our study). Robbins et al. (2021) and Blind et al. (2021) use a method similar to ours and estimate that the value of OSS created in the US is $38 billion in 2019 and that created in the EU is €1 billion in 2018. Wachs et al. (2022) show that roughly 50% of OSS contributions come from the US and EU combined. In aggregate, that would lead these studies to give a global value of OSS of $78 billion. Thus, our middle estimate of a supply-side value of $4.15 billion for only firm-oriented and widely used OSS is a credible lowerbound and highlights the higher estimations of the total of supply-side value of OSS when not considering whether or not a given OSS package is widely used. This further indicates that the supply-side value of the most widely used OSS is roughly 5.5% of the supply-side value of all OSS.\n\nThe second column in Table 2 contains the demand side estimates based on the labor market approach. We find that if firms had to recreate all OSS packages they used (e.g., OSS itself no longer existed and every firm that used an OSS package had to recreate it), then the entire cost would amount to between $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion using labor from the low wage or high wage country only, respectively. A pool of programmers across the globe could recreate all of OSS that is being widely used for a cost of approximately $8.80 trillion. Interpreting this number is\n\n19 Tables in the appendix show the equivalent values from Table 2 when including software language buckets 1 and 2 (Table A3) and all three software language buckets (Table A4).\n\nslightly more complicated but still feasible. According to a Statista (2023) report, global software revenue in 2020 (the same year as our data) was $531.7 billion. However, this represents a flow, not a stock, of software. Relying on government estimates that software fully depreciates over three years, we can do a back of the envelope calculation and consider the purchase value of the full stock of prepackaged software used in 2020 as the aggregate of that sold from 2018 to 2020, which is $1.54 trillion. Further, this represents only the expenditure on prepackaged software and does  not  include  custom  purchased  or  in-house  developed  software.  Here,  the  best  obtainable estimates of private-sector investment in software overall come from the United States National Income and Product Accounts data (NIPA 2023). In 2020, the national account data shows that in the  US,  private  firms  spent  $479.2  billion  on  software,  of  which  45%  ($215.5  billion)  was prepackaged. If we assume this is a consistent ratio for the rest of the world, then the total amount firms spent on software being used in 2020 was $3.4 trillion (= $1.54 trillion\/0.45). Combining this rough estimate with the demand side estimate of the value of OSS based on an average global wage ($8.8 trillion), this indicates firms would spend $12.2 trillion (=$3.4 trillion + $8.8 trillion), or three and a half times what they currently spend if they needed to pay in-house developers to write the OSS that they currently use for free.\n\nDocument 14: ## --- Figure 2 about here ---\n\nFigure 2 splits the OSS value estimates for each language by our inward facing (Census) and outward facing (BuiltWith) data sources. Panel A and Panel B focus on the supply and demand side estimation for the Census. We obtain a similar pattern that has been established already in the aggregate when pooling both data sources (Figure 1) albeit the impact of JavaScript is substantially lower.  On  the  supply  side  of  the  Census  in  Panel  A,  Java  has  the  second-highest  value  while JavaScript  code  from  the  Census  contributes  to  a  substantially  lower  value  to  the  aggregate. Similarly, the supply side values of C, Python, and Typescript are mainly driven by the Census. From the demand side Panel B we find that Go is the most popular language for inward facing code while all other languages appear to be negligible in relative terms.\n\nFigure 2, Panel C and Panel D show the supply and demand side values for the BuiltWith dataset. The supply side value in Panel C clearly indicates that the value from the BuiltWith sample is driven by JavaScript code, which is a good sanity check since we focused on JavaScript packages to proxy for OSS in the BuiltWith sample, as discussed above. The second highest value is created by TypeScript which is reassuring since it is a superset of JavaScript. Panel D shows a similar pattern  on  the  usage  side  where  most  of  the  value  arises  from  JavaScript  while  TypeScript  is trailing at the second spot as well. The other languages contribute only marginal amounts to the supply and demand side values. Overall, these findings are broadly consistent with the main use cases of the various languages (web programming vs. application programming) and an idea that languages through which value are generated are not necessarily identical to languages that are used by the general public.\n\n--- Figure 3 about here ---\n\nFigure 3 shows the demand-side value of OSS across industries by NAICS 2-digit codes using the BuiltWith online data. 20 This can be interpreted as the value each of these industries receive because OSS exists. The industry with the highest usage value of around $43 billion is 'Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.' 'Retail Trade' as well as 'Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services' make up another large part of the demand-side externally facing value of OSS with $36 billion and $35 billion, respectively. In contrast, industries that constitute just a small portion of the value are 'Mining, Quarrying, and Oil  and  Gas  Extraction',  'Utilities',  'Agriculture,  Forestry,  Fishing,  and  Hunting.'  The  latter industries are classical non-service sector industries and as such software is expected to play less of a role there.\n\nDocument 16: ## 5. Conclusion\n\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith. We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average value and distributed it across industries.\n\nIn this study we estimate the value of widely-used open source software globally with two unique datasets: the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data. We are able to estimate not only the supply side value of existing code (e.g., the cost it would take to rewrite each piece of widely-used OSS once) but also the demand side value for the private economy (e.g., the cost it would take for each company that uses a piece of OSS to rewrite it). While we do not focus on the long tail of OSS, we consider this an additional contribution of our study as focusing on OSS that is widely used allows us to more precisely understand the value created by OSS, rather than only measuring the  replacement  cost  for  all  OSS  (which  would  overestimate  the  true  value  since  many  OSS projects are not used in production code). However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n\nAdjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.  We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves.  Over  95%  percent  of  the  demand-side  value  is  generated  by  only  five  percent  of programmers, and those programmers contribute not only to a few widely used projects but to substantially more projects than the programmers that are engaged at the lower end of the value distribution.\n\nIn aggregate, our results show the substantial value that OSS contributes to the economy despite this value generally showing up as zero via direct measurement since prices equal zero and quantity is difficult to measure using public data alone. Our research lays the groundwork for future studies of not only OSS, but of all IT and its growing impact on the global economy.\n\nDocument 9: ## 3.1 Labor market approach\n\nFor the labor market approach, we estimate the value of OSS by calculating the replacement value of a package.

For simplicity we call it the goods market approach for which we provide the details and statistics, as well as the limitations in Appendix A.\n\npackage. 15 For each unique package,  , we calculate the value and then sum over all these values i to obtain the total value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nIn this calculation, we implicitly do not incorporate any production externalities since we assume that there is no spillover knowledge from one package to the next that would lower the cost of programming. 16 This methodology is similar to that used by other papers that estimate the supply-side costs of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021).\n\nWe then calculate the demand-side value of OSS by incorporating the usage information ( Q) for each package:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nHere, we do not incorporate consumption externalities, i.e., we do not allow a benefit to arise for the general public when a package has been created and we further make sure that each firm is only replacing a package they use once, since a replaced package can be used within a firm as a club good (e.g., see Cornes and Sandler, 1996). The value 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost to rewrite all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the concept of OSS still exists, but all of these packages needed to be rewritten from scratch), while the value 𝑉 + \"#$%&amp; reflects the cost for each firm that uses one of these OSS packages to pay a developer to rewrite those packages (e.g., OSS itself no longer exists).\n\nFor both the supply and demand models, we obtain the dollar-value for each package ( 𝑃 ( ) via the Constructive Cost Model II, also abbreviated as COCOMO II (Boehm 1984, Boehm et al. 2009). The model has previously been used by the United States Department of Defense to estimate software project costs as well as in prior research estimating the value of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021). It is a highly flexible model that allows us to create non-linear transformations of lines of code to dollar-values. It uses the following modelling equation:\n\n15 We use only the pure lines of code excluding documentation lines and empty lines. Hence, we underestimate the true value of recreating each package.\n\n16 Similar to a representative agent model (e.g. see Williamson 2006), one may think of each package being reproduced by separate programmers who are identical replicas of each other (and therefore have the same skill level, but do not become more efficient via learning).\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n( (\n\nwhere 𝐿 represents the lines of codes in thousands and E the effort in person-month units for each project  . Consistent with Blind et al. (2021), we use the default parameter values for i 𝛼 , 𝛽 and 𝜂. The parameters 𝛼 𝛽 , are non-linear adjustment factors set to 2.94, and 1.0997 respectively . The parameter 𝜂 is an effort-adjustment factor which can be modified to incorporate subjective assessments of product, hardware, personnel, and project attributes. Since we do not have a prior for each project, we set 𝜂 to the default value of one. To obtain the price ( 𝑃 ( ) of each OSS project, we  then  multiply  the  results  of  equation  (3)  by  the  weighted  global  wage  that  an  average programmer would obtain on the open market. To calculate a global wage, we include the base monthly salaries of software developers from Salary Expert for the top 30 countries in terms of their GitHub developer counts in 2021 (Wachs et al., 2022). 17 The weight of each country is its share of active GitHub contributors over the total contributors in the top 30 countries. We further create bounds by using a low-wage (India) and high-wage (USA) labor market for the wage to better understand how the value would vary by the pool of programmers used to recreate all of OSS. 18\n\nDocument 8: ## 3. Methodology\n\nWe first measure the value of OSS by considering the supply and the demand side of OSS using a labor market approach. 14 The thought experiment is that we live in a world where OSS does not exist and has to be recreated at each firm that uses a given piece of OSS. Using the labor market approach, we calculate the labor replacement cost of each OSS package. To estimate the value for each package, we use COCOMO II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) at the individual package level and then sum across all package values to obtain a supply-side labor market replacement value. Then, we scale the supply-side value by the number of times firms are using each package while removing multi-usage within each firm to obtain a demand-side value.\n\nSecond, we move beyond the aggregate and inspect inequality in the value creation process. In OSS, as with many creative endeavors, it is common that a small handful of individuals provide the bulk of the contributions, while many others make small contributions (sometimes referred to as the 80\/20 rule, implying 80% of the work is done by 20% of the people). Research has shown these frequent contributors often attain positions of influence in OSS communities as a result of their efforts (Hanisch, et al, 2018). Therefore, to better understand the dispersion of value creation across developers, we first use the GHTorrent data and identify individual developer contributions in two ways: a) through their OSS value contributions directly and b) through the total number of repositories they contributed to. We then test how concentrated these two contribution measures are to better understand whether many or few developers contribute to the total value we measure. We explain the exact details for the labor market approach and the inequality of valuations below.\n\nDocument 21: ## Appendix A) Goods-Market Valuation Approach\n\nAs an alternate estimation method, instead of using the labor replacement cost, we use a goods replacement value approach. We identify several OSS packages that have similar closed-source, pecuniary alternatives and consider the costs if all commercial users of the free OSS had to replace that software with a pecuniary alternative (similar to the calculations Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) performed for web servers). We can then use this alternate value of p , combined with the q values from above to estimate a goods replacement value of OSS. This method builds on suggestions from Nordhaus (2006, p. 146) who says '…the price of market and nonmarket goods and services should be imputed on the basis of the comparable market goods and services.' We do not expect the estimates from the two methods to be similar. Quite the contrary, the value of those two methods varies substantially since the latter goods-market approach assumes a fixed price to sell a good multiple times and that fixed price is usually lower than the total value estimated from recreating all packages on the labor side. The differential between these estimates is  essentially the result of a firm stepping in to reproduce the missing OSS packages and then selling them for a pecuniary price rather than all firms needing to reproduce those packages from scratch themselves.\n\nWith the goods market approach, the thought experiment is still that we live in a world where OSS does not exist, but it has to be recreated via one firm that then charges a price for a good that is currently free. To value OSS via the goods market approach, we created a basket of equivalent substitute proprietary goods that are priced on the open market as a stand-in for an OSS product.  This  methodology  is  consistent  with  that  used  in  the  prior  literature  (Greenstein  and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021) although both of those studies only used a single good rather than a basket since they were focused on only one type of OSS (web servers). Since there is no readily available database for proprietary equivalents of OSS, we conduct a search based on subjective  perception  of  popularity  of  OSS  and  we  then  search  for  pecuniary,  closed-source substitutes for them. The resulting basket of 20 OSS packages with proprietary substitutes is a good representation of the diversity of OSS. The software ranges from media and design software to statistical analysis programs, to database management and web server software. 21\n\n21 Table A5 shows the basket of OSS and their proprietary equivalents that we used. To create this basket, we looked for proprietary software that had an OSS equivalent that was similar in its overall function and feature set, and sought to identify pairs of software that, in aggregate, captured a broad and representative set of the types of OSS that exist.\n\nBased on our OSS equivalent substitute proprietary goods basket we then obtain prices for each proprietary software equivalent and we calculated the COCOMO labor market supply-side value for each OSS product in the basket which we use as a proxy - for lack of the code from the proprietary software - for the COCOMO labor supply side value of the proprietary software (e.g., the cost it would take to pay a programmer to write that proprietary software from scratch). We then calculate the average COCOMO labor supply-side value of the basket, 𝑉 !,1#23.4 ,  and  the average price for the basket, 𝑃 !,1#23.4 . 22 Since, we know the labor market supply-side value of all OSS, 𝑉 ! \"#$%&amp; , we can setup the following equation and obtain the price of OSS, 𝑃 ! for the goodsmarket for all OSS via a simple scaling transformation:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nThis results in the following goods-market supply-side value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nWe can then obtain the equivalent demand-side goods-market values as follows:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nFrom the goods market side, we consider the equivalent price that a firm would charge if it produced all existing widely used OSS and then sold it as a product to customers.\n\nTable A6, column 3 shows that the value on the demand side ranges between $177 million and $244 million across the different buckets independent of the country of origin from which programmers are hired. Naturally, the goods-market value will be substantially smaller than the labor demand value since this imaginary firm will make a profit at a comparatively low price by producing the software once and then selling it to many customers. Further, while Greenstein and Nagle (2014) as well as Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) focus on one particular type of software only (web servers), we attempt to expand on their approach to many goods. However, the data limitations become a stronger constraint in this context which makes it inherently more difficult\n\n22 We obtained the average price of the goods-market proprietary basket by using a 3 years lifespan of software, i.e. 1\/(1-0.66), so the depreciation factor is 0.33. This is consistent with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules for depreciating software, which states 'If you can depreciate the cost of computer software, use the straight line method over a useful life of 36 months.' https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/publications\/p946#en\\_US\\_2022\\_publink1000107354.\n\nto  estimate  the  value  through  this  approach  while  requiring  substantially  more  assumptions. Instead of a pure goods-market approach, this requires assistance from the labor-market approach in terms of scaling for the estimate, which ultimately leads to a substantial underestimate of the value of OSS. Further, the pricing strategy of the proprietary software counterparts is sensitive to the  market  demand.  With  the  goods-market  approach  extending  to  multiple  goods,  the  strong implicit assumption is that the market demands for our basket software and our sample OSS are similar, so they lead to commensurate prices.\n\nAn alternative and even more simplified goods-market back-of-the-envelope calculation that does not account for lines of code and relies on no scaling from the labor market approach would simply be to multiply a price of a reference good with the usage. We can take the minimum, average, and maximum prices of the basket of proprietary goods as captured in the reference price vector p = (69.99, 1610.17, 5800) and simply multiply it with usage from the combined Census and BuiltWith sample (Table 1). Based on those imputed proprietary price assumptions, the goods market demand side value would range from $0.2 - $16.5 trillion (minimum price - maximum price)  with  the  mean  price  resulting  in  a  value  estimate  of  $4.5  trillion.  However,  while  this estimate creates slightly more variance than the labor market approach, it is inherently flawed by simply assuming that the imputed prices are identical for each open source product based on the reference price. We further think this very simple back-of-the-envelope is an orange to apples comparison since the goods in our basket are fully functional, stand-alone software packages, while the packages in the Census and BuiltWith datasets are comprised of application libraries, which are generally smaller than such stand-alone packages.\n\nGiven all the complexities and assumptions one has to make due to lack of data for a goodsmarket approach, we place stronger emphasis on the labor cost approach highlighted in the main body but we include this method here for completeness.\n\nDocument 11: ## 4. Results\n\nAfter applying the labor market approach using COCOMO II, we obtain global estimates for the value of OSS. To calculate the overall value, we first need the underlying number of lines of code (to calculate the supply-side value) and then the usage statistics (for the demand-side value). Since there may be substantial heterogeneity in value by programming languages, we also show the top programming languages during our investigation period in the year 2020, as discussed above.","conversation_history":[{"role":"user","content":"I'm interested in the methodology used to estimate the supply-side value of OSS in the labor market approach."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How can I help you with that?"}],"metadata":{"question_type":"conversational","seed_document_id":9,"topic":"Others"}}
