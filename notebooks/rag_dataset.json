A  pervasive example is open source software (OSS), a global public good that plays a vital role in the economy and is foundational for most technology we use today. However, it is difficult to measure the value of OSS due to its non-pecuniary nature and lack of centralized usage tracking. Therefore, OSS remains largely unaccounted for in economic measures. Although prior studies have estimated the supply-side costs to recreate this software, a lack of data has hampered estimating the much larger demand-side (usage) value created by OSS. Therefore, to understand the complete economic and social value of widely-used OSS, we leverage unique global data from two complementary sources capturing  OSS  usage  by  millions  of  global  firms.  We  first  estimate  the  supply-side  value  by calculating the cost to recreate the most widely used OSS once. We then calculate the demandside value based on a replacement value for each firm that uses the software and would need to build it internally if OSS did not exist. We estimate the supply-side value of widely-used OSS is $4.15 billion, but that the demand-side value is much larger at $8.8 trillion. We find that firms would need to spend 3.5 times more on software than they currently do if OSS did not exist. The top six programming languages in our sample comprise 84% of the demand-side value of OSS.

This involves estimating the resources and expenses required to develop the software from scratch, essentially assessing the cost of production. The authors estimate the supply-side value of widely-used OSS to be $4.15 billion.\n\n2. **Demand-Side Value Estimation**: The demand-side value is assessed based on a replacement value for each firm that uses the software. This involves calculating how much it would cost each firm to internally build the software if OSS did not exist. This approach captures the economic value that firms derive from using OSS without having to develop it themselves. The authors estimate the demand-side value to be significantly larger, at $8.8 trillion.\n\nThe key difference between these values lies in their focus: the supply-side value reflects the cost of creating the software, while the demand-side value reflects the economic benefit and savings realized by firms using the software. The demand-side value is much larger, indicating that the economic impact of OSS on users is far greater than the cost of its creation.",

Introduction\n\nIn 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that 'software is eating the world' (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that 'open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,' (Jacks, 2022). Other recent studies have come to similar conclusions showing that open source software  (OSS)  -  software  whose  source  code  is  publicly  available  for  inspection,  use,  and modification and is often created in a decentralized manner and distributed for free - appears in 96% of codebases (Synopsys 2023), and that some commercial software consists of up to 99.9% freely available OSS (Musseau et al., 2022). Although in its early days OSS frequently copied features from existing proprietary software, OSS today includes cutting edge technology in various fields including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, big data, and analytics.  However, despite the increasing importance of OSS to all software (and therefore to the entire economy), measuring its impact has been elusive. Traditionally, to measure the value created by a good or service,  economists  multiply  the  price  ( p )  times  the  quantity  sold  ( q ).  However,  in  OSS, p is generally zero since the source code is publicly available, and q is  unknown due to the limited number of restrictions around how the code may be copied and reused. For example, if a company downloads  a  piece  of  OSS  from  a  public  code  repository,  it  may  copy  it  thousands  of  times internally (legally) and then share it with suppliers or customers (also legally), so public download data is insufficient. Although some recent studies have sought to estimate the value of p (discussed below), data for estimating q has been unavailable or intractable for anything more than just a handful of OSS packages. Using newly collected data from multiple sources, the goal of this paper is to provide estimates for both p and q and to use those to shine light on the question: What is the value of open source software?\n\nUnderstanding the value of OSS is of critical importance not only due to the role it plays in the economy, but also due to it being one of the most successful and impactful modern examples of the centuries old economic concept of 'the commons' which run the risk of meeting the fate known as 'the tragedy of the commons.' This concept can trace its roots as far back as the 4 th -century BC philosopher Aristotle who wrote 'That which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care. Men pay most attention to what is their own and care less for what is common.'  (Aristotle,  1981).  William  Forster  Lloyd  (1833)  resurfaced  the  idea  in  modern economic thought by highlighting the example of shared tracts of land used for cattle grazing by\n\nmultiple cattle herders who each had an incentive to overuse the shared resource. Garrett Hardin (1968)  brought  the  concept  into  the  broader  zeitgeist  when  he  wrote  an  article  discussing  the problem entitled 'The Tragedy of the Commons.' Building on this work, Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for her research highlighting paths to avoiding the tragedy of the commons through community coordination efforts that did not necessitate government enforced laws to manage and guard the commons (Ostrom 1990)."

            "reference_answer": "Open source software (OSS) holds significant importance in the modern economy due to its widespread adoption and integration into various technological fields. As highlighted in the introduction of the document, OSS is now a critical component of the software industry, appearing in 96% of codebases and sometimes constituting up to 99.9% of commercial software. This prevalence underscores its role in driving innovation and supporting cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, big data, and analytics.\n\nThe significance of OSS also lies in its embodiment of the economic concept of 'the commons,' where resources are shared and managed collectively. This model has proven to be one of the most successful and impactful examples in modern times, contributing to the economy by providing freely available software that can be inspected, used, and modified by anyone.\n\nHowever, measuring the value of OSS presents challenges. Traditional economic measures of value, which involve multiplying the price (p) by the quantity sold (q), are not applicable to OSS. The price is generally zero since the source code is publicly available, and the quantity is unknown due to the lack of restrictions on how the code can be copied and reused. For instance, a company might download OSS and legally replicate it thousands of times internally or share it with others, making public download data insufficient for estimating its usage.\n\nThese challenges highlight the difficulty in quantifying the impact of OSS on the economy, despite its clear importance. The document suggests that new data sources are being used to estimate both the price and quantity of OSS to better understand its value, which is crucial given its role in the economy and its potential vulnerability to the 'tragedy of the commons.'",

            "reference_answer": "The concept of 'the tragedy of the commons' refers to a situation where a shared resource is overused and depleted because individuals act in their own self-interest rather than considering the common good. This concept, which dates back to Aristotle and was popularized by Garrett Hardin, highlights the challenges of managing resources that are accessible to all but owned by none. In the context of open source software (OSS), the tragedy of the commons can manifest when the software, which is freely available and can be modified and distributed by anyone, is not adequately maintained or supported. Since OSS is a public good, there is a risk that it may receive insufficient care and attention, as individuals and organizations might rely on it without contributing to its development or upkeep.\n\nElinor Ostrom's research provides potential solutions to this issue by demonstrating that community coordination can effectively manage common resources without the need for government intervention. Ostrom's work emphasizes the importance of collective action and self-governance, where communities establish rules and norms to manage shared resources sustainably. In the case of OSS, this could involve creating collaborative frameworks where developers, users, and organizations contribute to the software's maintenance and improvement. By fostering a sense of shared responsibility and encouraging contributions from a broad base of stakeholders, the OSS community can avoid the tragedy of the commons and ensure the software remains robust and valuable.",

Introduction\n\nIn 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that 'software is eating the world' (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that 'open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,' (Jacks, 2022). Other recent studies have come to similar conclusions showing that open source software  (OSS)  -  software  whose  source  code  is  publicly  available  for  inspection,  use,  and modification and is often created in a decentralized manner and distributed for free - appears in 96% of codebases (Synopsys 2023), and that some commercial software consists of up to 99.9% freely available OSS (Musseau et al., 2022). Although in its early days OSS frequently copied features from existing proprietary software, OSS today includes cutting edge technology in various fields including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, big data, and analytics.  However, despite the increasing importance of OSS to all software (and therefore to the entire economy), measuring its impact has been elusive. Traditionally, to measure the value created by a good or service,  economists  multiply  the  price  ( p )  times  the  quantity  sold  ( q ).  However,  in  OSS, p is generally zero since the source code is publicly available, and q is  unknown due to the limited number of restrictions around how the code may be copied and reused. For example, if a company downloads  a  piece  of  OSS  from  a  public  code  repository,  it  may  copy  it  thousands  of  times internally (legally) and then share it with suppliers or customers (also legally), so public download data is insufficient. Although some recent studies have sought to estimate the value of p (discussed below), data for estimating q has been unavailable or intractable for anything more than just a handful of OSS packages. Using newly collected data from multiple sources, the goal of this paper is to provide estimates for both p and q and to use those to shine light on the question: What is the value of open source software?\n\nUnderstanding the value of OSS is of critical importance not only due to the role it plays in the economy, but also due to it being one of the most successful and impactful modern examples of the centuries old economic concept of 'the commons' which run the risk of meeting the fate known as 'the tragedy of the commons.' This concept can trace its roots as far back as the 4 th -century BC philosopher Aristotle who wrote 'That which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care. Men pay most attention to what is their own and care less for what is common.'  (Aristotle,  1981).  William  Forster  Lloyd  (1833)  resurfaced  the  idea  in  modern economic thought by highlighting the example of shared tracts of land used for cattle grazing by\n\nmultiple cattle herders who each had an incentive to overuse the shared resource. Garrett Hardin (1968)  brought  the  concept  into  the  broader  zeitgeist  when  he  wrote  an  article  discussing  the problem entitled 'The Tragedy of the Commons.' Building on this work, Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for her research highlighting paths to avoiding the tragedy of the commons through community coordination efforts that did not necessitate government enforced laws to manage and guard the commons (Ostrom 1990)."

The parallels between shared grazing lands and shared digital infrastructure are palpable - the availability of communal grass to feed cattle, and in turn feed people, was critical to the agrarian economy, and the ability to not have to recreate code that someone else has already written is critical to the modern economy. Further, in both contexts, despite knowing grass and code are critical inputs to the economy, measuring their actual value is difficult. And, as the renowned mathematician and physicist Lord Kelvin is believed to have said, 'If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.' And if you cannot improve and maintain it, such common goods may crumble under the weight of their own success as they are overused, but underinvested in (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021). Therefore, measuring the value OSS creates is crucial to the future health of the digital economy, and the rest of the economy that is built on top of it.\n\nImportantly, recent studies have attempted to address these measurement issues but fall short of capturing both the breadth and depth of OSS usage - a gap we seek to fill with this paper. For example, researchers have attempted to gain breadth by using novel methodologies to estimate the labor replacement value of the current corpus of OSS created in the United States at $38 billion in 2019 (Robbins et al., 2021) and that created in the European Union at \u20ac1 billion (Blind et al., 2021) by imputing the labor costs that it would have taken to rewrite existing OSS. Such efforts do a very good job at estimating what it would cost to replace all existing OSS if it disappeared tomorrow. However, the resultant estimates rely on two important assumptions. First, that all OSS is equally valuable from a usage standpoint, and second that the concept of OSS would still exist, and society would just need to rewrite the code once, thus addressing the aforementioned problem of a missing value for p , but not addressing the missing value of q . In a world where OSS did not exist at all, then each piece of OSS software would not need to be rewritten just once, but instead would need to be rewritten by every firm that used the software (assuming the firm could freely share the software within its boundaries). Other research (Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; MurcianoGoroff, Zhuo, and Greenstein, 2021) has gone deeper into this hypothetical, albeit in a narrow\n\nmanner, by only focusing on web servers (which are public facing on the Internet and can therefore be readily measured). Using different methods, both studies measure q for this one type of software and impute p by using a goods replacement value approach based on the prices for closed-source alternatives offered by firms. With data from the United States the resulting estimates show a value of  $2  billion  for  the  OSS  Apache  Web  Server  in  2012  (Greenstein  and  Nagle,  2014)  and  a combined value of $4.5 billion for Apache and the increasingly popular OSS web server nginx in 2018 (Murciano-Goroff, et al., 2021). However, although web servers are an important part of the OSS  ecosystem,  they  constitute  a  small  portion  of  it.  We  seek  to  build  upon  the  important contributions this existing research has made in an attempt to go both broad and deep to create a more complete measure of the value of OSS.\n\nTo consider the value of OSS in both a broad and deep manner, we use data from two primary sources that allow us to gain insights into the OSS used at tens of thousands of firms across the world.

This concept is based on the idea that when a resource is shared among multiple users, each user has an incentive to maximize their own benefit from the resource, often at the expense of the resource's long-term sustainability. Hardin's article highlighted the challenges of managing common resources, such as shared grazing lands, where each herder might overgraze their cattle, leading to the depletion of the grassland.\n\nElinor Ostrom's research provides solutions to the \"Tragedy of the Commons\" by demonstrating that community coordination and self-governance can effectively manage shared resources without the need for government-enforced laws. Ostrom identified various principles for successful management of common resources, such as clearly defined boundaries, collective decision-making, monitoring, and conflict resolution mechanisms. Her work showed that communities could develop their own rules and norms to sustainably manage shared resources, thereby avoiding the tragedy.\n\nThe concept of the \"Tragedy of the Commons\" relates to the management of shared digital infrastructure like Open Source Software (OSS) in that OSS is a communal resource that can be overused and underinvested in, similar to physical commons. Just as shared grazing lands require careful management to prevent overuse, OSS requires coordination and investment to ensure its sustainability and continued development. The parallels are evident in the need for community involvement and collaboration to maintain and improve OSS, much like the community-driven solutions Ostrom advocated for managing physical commons. The challenge lies in measuring the value of OSS and ensuring that it receives adequate investment and maintenance to prevent it from crumbling under its own success, as it is a critical input to the modern economy.",

One primary challenge is the difficulty in capturing both the breadth and depth of OSS usage. Current methodologies often fall short in this regard, leading to an incomplete understanding of OSS's true economic impact.\n\nThe limitations of the current methodologies used to estimate the labor replacement value of OSS include:\n\n1. **Assumption of Equal Value**: These methodologies assume that all OSS is equally valuable from a usage standpoint. This is a significant limitation because it overlooks the varying degrees of importance and utility that different OSS projects may have for different users or industries.\n\n2. **Single Rewrite Assumption**: The methodologies also assume that if OSS were to disappear, it would only need to be rewritten once. This does not account for the scenario where each firm using the software would need to rewrite it independently, which would significantly increase the labor and cost involved.\n\n3. **Narrow Focus**: Some studies have focused narrowly on specific types of software, such as web servers, which, while important, represent only a small portion of the entire OSS ecosystem. This narrow focus limits the ability to generalize findings to the broader OSS landscape.\n\nThese limitations affect the understanding of OSS's true economic impact by providing an incomplete picture. The estimates derived from these methodologies may undervalue the actual contribution of OSS to the economy, as they do not fully account for the diverse and widespread use of OSS across different sectors. Additionally, by not considering the potential need for multiple rewrites in the absence of OSS, the methodologies may underestimate the true cost and effort required to replace OSS, thereby undervaluing its economic significance.",

We  seek  to  build  upon  the  important contributions this existing research has made in an attempt to go both broad and deep to create a more complete measure of the value of OSS.\n\nTo consider the value of OSS in both a broad and deep manner, we use data from two primary sources that allow us to gain insights into the OSS used at tens of thousands of firms across the world. The first is the 'Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries' (Nagle et al., 2022). The Census II project utilized partnerships with multiple software composition analysis (SCA) firms to create various lists of the most widely used OSS. SCAs are hired to scan the codebases of a company to ensure they are not violating any OSS licenses and, as a byproduct, track all the OSS code used by their customers and the products they build. The Census II project aggregated data from multiple SCAs to build a dataset of OSS usage at tens of thousands of firms based  on  millions  of  data  points  (observations  of  OSS  usage).  The  second  data  source  is  the BuiltWith dataset, from which we leverage scans of nearly nine million websites to identify the underlying technology deployed by these websites, including OSS libraries. The BuiltWith data has been used in multiple academic studies (DeStefano &amp; Timmis 2023, Dushnitsky &amp; Stroube 2021, Koning et al.. 2022), but to our knowledge this is the first one to focus on OSS usage. The Census II data and the BuiltWith data are complementary as the former focuses on OSS that is built  into  the  software  a  company  sells,  while  the  latter  focuses  on  OSS  that  is  built  into  a company's website, thus reducing the chances of double-counting observations across the datasets. In aggregate, these two datasets combined create the most complete measurement of OSS usage ( q ) to date. Further, by focusing on OSS that is widely deployed and used by firms, rather than considering all the projects that exist in an OSS repository, we enhance the methodologies of prior studies by reducing the likelihood of measurement error stemming from projects that are posted as publicly available OSS but are not actually used in any practical manner. Not accounting for this\n\nmeasurement error would lead to overestimation of the actual value of OSS as projects that are widely used would be valued in the same way as projects that are not used at all.\n\nTo estimate p ,  we  follow  the  literature  discussed  above  and  use  the  labor  replacement value. First, we calculate the labor cost it would take an individual firm to recreate a given OSS package by measuring the number of lines of code within the package and then applying the Constructive Cost Model II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) - also known as COCOMO II to estimate the number of person-hours it would take to write the code from scratch. We then utilize global wage data from Salary Expert to get an accurate estimate of the labor costs a firm would incur if this piece of OSS did not exist. These costs can be combined with the q values from above at the OSS package level to estimate the combined value of all OSS from both the supply and demand sides.\n\nWe find a value ranging from $1.22 billion to $6.22 billion if we were to decide as a society to recreate all widely used OSS on the supply side. However, considering the actual usage of OSS leads to a demand-side value that is orders of magnitude larger and ranges from $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion, if each firm who used an OSS package had to recreate it from scratch (e.g., the concept of OSS did not exist). We document substantial heterogeneity of the value of OSS by programming  language  and  internal  vs  outward-facing  programming  efforts.

This is done by measuring the number of lines of code within the package and applying the Constructive Cost Model II (COCOMO II). COCOMO II is a model used to estimate the number of person-hours required to write the code from scratch. Once the person-hours are estimated, global wage data from Salary Expert is used to determine the labor costs a firm would incur if the OSS did not exist.\n\nThis methodology contributes to understanding the value of OSS from both the supply and demand sides. On the supply side, it provides an estimate of the cost to society if it were to recreate all widely used OSS, which ranges from $1.22 billion to $6.22 billion. On the demand side, it estimates the value of OSS based on actual usage, which is significantly larger, ranging from $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion. This demand-side value reflects the cost savings for firms that use OSS instead of developing equivalent software from scratch. By combining these estimates with the usage data (q values) from the Census II and BuiltWith datasets, the study provides a comprehensive measure of the value of OSS, highlighting the substantial economic impact and efficiency gains associated with its widespread use.",

We  seek  to  build  upon  the  important contributions this existing research has made in an attempt to go both broad and deep to create a more complete measure of the value of OSS.\n\nTo consider the value of OSS in both a broad and deep manner, we use data from two primary sources that allow us to gain insights into the OSS used at tens of thousands of firms across the world. The first is the 'Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries' (Nagle et al., 2022). The Census II project utilized partnerships with multiple software composition analysis (SCA) firms to create various lists of the most widely used OSS. SCAs are hired to scan the codebases of a company to ensure they are not violating any OSS licenses and, as a byproduct, track all the OSS code used by their customers and the products they build. The Census II project aggregated data from multiple SCAs to build a dataset of OSS usage at tens of thousands of firms based  on  millions  of  data  points  (observations  of  OSS  usage).  The  second  data  source  is  the BuiltWith dataset, from which we leverage scans of nearly nine million websites to identify the underlying technology deployed by these websites, including OSS libraries. The BuiltWith data has been used in multiple academic studies (DeStefano &amp; Timmis 2023, Dushnitsky &amp; Stroube 2021, Koning et al.. 2022), but to our knowledge this is the first one to focus on OSS usage. The Census II data and the BuiltWith data are complementary as the former focuses on OSS that is built  into  the  software  a  company  sells,  while  the  latter  focuses  on  OSS  that  is  built  into  a company's website, thus reducing the chances of double-counting observations across the datasets. In aggregate, these two datasets combined create the most complete measurement of OSS usage ( q ) to date. Further, by focusing on OSS that is widely deployed and used by firms, rather than considering all the projects that exist in an OSS repository, we enhance the methodologies of prior studies by reducing the likelihood of measurement error stemming from projects that are posted as publicly available OSS but are not actually used in any practical manner. Not accounting for this\n\nmeasurement error would lead to overestimation of the actual value of OSS as projects that are widely used would be valued in the same way as projects that are not used at all.\n\nTo estimate p ,  we  follow  the  literature  discussed  above  and  use  the  labor  replacement value. First, we calculate the labor cost it would take an individual firm to recreate a given OSS package by measuring the number of lines of code within the package and then applying the Constructive Cost Model II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) - also known as COCOMO II to estimate the number of person-hours it would take to write the code from scratch. We then utilize global wage data from Salary Expert to get an accurate estimate of the labor costs a firm would incur if this piece of OSS did not exist. These costs can be combined with the q values from above at the OSS package level to estimate the combined value of all OSS from both the supply and demand sides.\n\nWe find a value ranging from $1.22 billion to $6.22 billion if we were to decide as a society to recreate all widely used OSS on the supply side. However, considering the actual usage of OSS leads to a demand-side value that is orders of magnitude larger and ranges from $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion, if each firm who used an OSS package had to recreate it from scratch (e.g., the concept of OSS did not exist). We document substantial heterogeneity of the value of OSS by programming  language  and  internal  vs  outward-facing  programming  efforts.  Further,  we  find considerable  heterogeneity  in  value  contributions  by  programmers  as  5%  of  programmers  are responsible for more than 90% of the value created on the supply- and demand- side.

            "reference_answer": "The findings related to the heterogeneity of OSS value contributions by programming language and programmer involvement highlight significant disparities in how value is distributed within the OSS ecosystem. The study reveals that the value of OSS varies considerably depending on the programming language used and whether the programming efforts are internal or outward-facing. This suggests that certain programming languages or types of projects may be more critical or valuable to firms, potentially due to their widespread adoption, efficiency, or the specific needs they address.\n\nAdditionally, the study finds that a small percentage of programmers\u20145%\u2014are responsible for more than 90% of the value created on both the supply and demand sides. This indicates a concentration of expertise and contribution within a relatively small group of individuals, which could have several implications for the OSS ecosystem.\n\nImplications for the OSS ecosystem include:\n\n1. **Resource Allocation**: Understanding which programming languages and projects contribute the most value can help firms and developers prioritize their resources and efforts. This can lead to more strategic investments in certain OSS projects or languages that are deemed more valuable.\n\n2. **Talent Recognition and Development**: The concentration of value creation among a small group of programmers suggests the need for recognizing and nurturing talent within the OSS community. Encouraging more widespread participation and contribution could help distribute the workload and potentially increase the overall value generated by OSS.\n\n3. **Risk Management**: The reliance on a small group of programmers for a significant portion of value creation could pose risks to the sustainability and resilience of the OSS ecosystem. If these key contributors were to stop participating, it could impact the development and maintenance of critical OSS projects.\n\n4. **Policy and Support**: For policymakers and organizations supporting OSS, these findings underscore the importance of creating environments that encourage diverse participation and reduce barriers to entry for new contributors. This could involve providing training, resources, or incentives to broaden the base of active contributors.\n\nOverall, these findings emphasize the need for a more inclusive and balanced approach to OSS development, ensuring that the ecosystem remains robust and capable of meeting the diverse needs of its users.",

While prior estimates of the value of OSS only went either broad (estimating the supply-side costs of a large swath of OSS) or deep (estimating the value created by one particular type of OSS), this study does both by using unique datasets that allow for a better understanding of the breadth and depth of OSS usage. Further, rather than measuring the value of all OSS, this study focuses on the value of OSS that is used by firms\n\nto create its products and websites, limiting the measurement error occurring in studies that are unable to account for which OSS is actually used in production. This contribution builds upon, and extends, important research (e.g., Blind et al., 2021; Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021; Robbins et al., 2021) that has sought to identify the value of this vital resource that contributes a great deal to the modern economy despite the difficulties measuring this contribution. In  doing  so,  it  adds  insights  to  a  long-running  discussion  related  to  the  impact  of  information technology (IT) on productivity (Brynjolfsson, 1993; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 1996; Nagle, 2019a; Solow, 1987) known as the 'productivity paradox' where IT investments can have limited impact on productivity statistics. This debate has continued into the emerging context of AI (Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson, 2018). Our work contributes to this conversation by highlighting a massive societal level cost-savings (and hence productivity enhancement) that is created by the existence of OSS.\n\nSecond, our research contributes methodological advances to the study of intangible capital by highlighting novel sources of data related to investments in OSS. Prior research has shown that intangible capital plays an increasingly important role in economic growth (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel,  2009)  and  firm  value  (Peters  and  Taylor,  2017),  but  it  often  goes  unmeasured  or misattributed (Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou, 2014). Further, we demonstrate how these data sources can be used to understand the true investments in software that a firm makes, and that which they would have to make if OSS did not exist.  This  is  valuable  as  investments  in  software  are  an increasingly important type of intangible capital that is driving innovation (Branstetter, Drev, and Kwon, 2019) and performance (Krishnan et al., 2000).\n\nThird, our results help highlight for firms and managers the importance of OSS to their production, and ideally add weight to arguments that users of OSS should not just free ride but also contribute to the creation and maintenance of OSS (e.g., Henkel, 2008; Nagle, 2018). Such contributions are a fraction of the costs that firms would incur if OSS did not exist and the active participation of OSS users in helping maintain the OSS they use is critical to the health and future well-being of the OSS ecosystem (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021; Zhang et al., 2019).\n\nFourth,  and  finally,  our  study  helps  inform  policymakers  who  have  recently  started  to understand  the  growing  importance  of  OSS  to  the  economy  and  taken  actions  to  support  the ecosystem (European Commission, 2020; Executive Order No. 14028, 2021)."

In  doing  so,  it  adds  insights  to  a  long-running  discussion  related  to  the  impact  of  information technology (IT) on productivity (Brynjolfsson, 1993; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 1996; Nagle, 2019a; Solow, 1987) known as the 'productivity paradox' where IT investments can have limited impact on productivity statistics. This debate has continued into the emerging context of AI (Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson, 2018). Our work contributes to this conversation by highlighting a massive societal level cost-savings (and hence productivity enhancement) that is created by the existence of OSS.\n\nSecond, our research contributes methodological advances to the study of intangible capital by highlighting novel sources of data related to investments in OSS. Prior research has shown that intangible capital plays an increasingly important role in economic growth (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel,  2009)  and  firm  value  (Peters  and  Taylor,  2017),  but  it  often  goes  unmeasured  or misattributed (Eisfeldt and Papanikolaou, 2014). Further, we demonstrate how these data sources can be used to understand the true investments in software that a firm makes, and that which they would have to make if OSS did not exist.  This  is  valuable  as  investments  in  software  are  an increasingly important type of intangible capital that is driving innovation (Branstetter, Drev, and Kwon, 2019) and performance (Krishnan et al., 2000).\n\nThird, our results help highlight for firms and managers the importance of OSS to their production, and ideally add weight to arguments that users of OSS should not just free ride but also contribute to the creation and maintenance of OSS (e.g., Henkel, 2008; Nagle, 2018). Such contributions are a fraction of the costs that firms would incur if OSS did not exist and the active participation of OSS users in helping maintain the OSS they use is critical to the health and future well-being of the OSS ecosystem (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021; Zhang et al., 2019).\n\nFourth,  and  finally,  our  study  helps  inform  policymakers  who  have  recently  started  to understand  the  growing  importance  of  OSS  to  the  economy  and  taken  actions  to  support  the ecosystem (European Commission, 2020; Executive Order No. 14028, 2021)."

            "reference_answer": "The study highlights the critical role that firms and managers play in the open-source software (OSS) ecosystem. It emphasizes the importance of not just using OSS but also actively contributing to its creation and maintenance. This involvement is crucial for several reasons:\n\n1. **Sustainability of the OSS Ecosystem**: The study points out that OSS is a vital resource for modern economic productivity, offering significant cost savings and productivity enhancements. However, the health and future well-being of the OSS ecosystem depend on the active participation of its users. By contributing to OSS, firms help ensure its sustainability and continued development, which is essential for maintaining the benefits they derive from it.\n\n2. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Contributions to OSS are a fraction of the costs that firms would incur if OSS did not exist. By investing in the maintenance and development of OSS, firms can avoid the higher costs associated with developing proprietary software solutions from scratch.\n\n3. **Innovation and Performance**: The study suggests that investments in software, including OSS, are a critical type of intangible capital driving innovation and performance. By contributing to OSS, firms can influence its development in ways that align with their needs, potentially leading to innovations that enhance their competitive advantage.\n\n4. **Community and Collaboration**: Active participation in the OSS community fosters collaboration and knowledge sharing, which can lead to improved software quality and functionality. This collaborative environment can also provide firms with access to a broader pool of talent and ideas.\n\n5. **Reputation and Influence**: Firms that contribute to OSS can enhance their reputation within the tech community, potentially attracting top talent and building goodwill among customers and partners. Additionally, by being active contributors, firms can have a say in the direction of OSS projects that are critical to their operations.\n\nOverall, the study underscores that while firms benefit significantly from using OSS, their contributions are essential to maintaining the ecosystem that supports these benefits. By investing in OSS, firms not only support its sustainability but also gain strategic advantages that can enhance their innovation, performance, and reputation.",

Empirical Setting and Data\n\nAlthough the concept of free and open software has existed since the 1950's, it became more popular in the 1980's due to the efforts of Richard Stallman and his launch of the GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation (Maracke, 2019). However, it was in the 1990's that OSS took off after Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel, a now widely adopted OSS operating system (Tozzi, 2016). Today, OSS is considered a key building block of the digital economy and is widely used by software developers in everything from phones to cars to refrigerators to cutting-edge AI (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021).\n\nWe use two complementary main data sources to estimate the value of OSS. The first is the Census and is inward facing. It allows us to identify OSS code that goes into products that firms create. The second dataset is BuiltWith and is outward facing, allowing us to identify OSS code  that  consumers  directly  interact  with  through  firm  websites.  Since  the  raw  data  in  both datasets only contains package names, version numbers, and package manager names, and does not  contain  any  source  code  related  information,  we  first  obtain  the  publicly  accessible  code repository for each package which includes package-level information including the lines of code and  the  programming  languages  used.  One  may  worry  about  double-counting  for  the  value calculations as a result of using two separate datasets. However, the overlap of both the Census and  the  BuiltWith  sample  is  very  small:  there  are  only  18  packages  found  in  both  datasets. Moreover, it is unlikely that double counting is a concern as the two datasets capture different dimensions of OSS usage: the Census captures packaged software whose usage is inward-facing while BuiltWith captures usage in websites that are outward-facing. Finally, as a supplementary\n\ndataset, we use GHTorrent, a detailed history of OSS-related activity on GitHub, the most popular OSS hosting platform and a commonly used data source for studies of OSS (e.g., Burton et al, 2017; Conti, Peukert, and Roche, 2023; Fackler, Hofmann, and Laurentsyeva, 2023; Kim, 2020; Tang, Wang, &amp; Tong, 2023). This detailed historical data allows us to go deeper into how the value  of  OSS  is  created  by  better  understanding  the  dispersion  of  the  contributions  across individual OSS developers. We describe the details of all three data sources and their preparation for estimation below.\n\nCensus.

During this period, software was often shared freely among researchers and developers, primarily in academic and research settings.\n\n2. **1980s**: The 1980s marked a significant turning point for OSS with the efforts of Richard Stallman. Stallman launched the GNU Project and founded the Free Software Foundation. His work was pivotal in promoting the idea of software freedom and the development of free software. The GNU Project aimed to create a free Unix-like operating system, and it laid the groundwork for many OSS principles and practices.\n\n3. **1990s**: The 1990s saw a major surge in the popularity and adoption of OSS, largely due to the release of the Linux kernel by Linus Torvalds. The Linux operating system, which combined the Linux kernel with GNU software, became a widely adopted OSS platform. This period marked the beginning of OSS as a key building block of the digital economy, with its use expanding into various domains, including consumer electronics and emerging technologies.\n\nThese milestones and figures were instrumental in shaping the OSS movement, leading to its widespread use and recognition as a critical component of modern software development and the digital economy.",

We describe the details of all three data sources and their preparation for estimation below.\n\nCensus. The  Census  II  of  Free  and  Open  Source  Software  (here:  Census)  was  jointly undertaken by the Linux Foundation and the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (Nagle et  al.,  2022). 1 The  Census  was  created  via  the  aggregation  of  data  from  three  major  software composition analysis (SCA) firms with thousands of clients across the globe. SCAs are hired to scan the codebase of a client and gather the OSS usage embedded in their proprietary software to ensure they are not violating any OSS license agreements.  Frequently this takes place as part of 2 the due diligence process related to mergers and acquisitions. Unlike other OSS demand measures available from public sources such as package download counts and code changes, the way this data was collected ensures that we observe the precise amount and type of internal OSS usage of the firms. In addition, it allows us to trace the dependencies each package relies on, so that we can observe the indirect OSS usage that is commonly hidden and difficult to obtain.  The result is over 3 2.7 million observations of OSS packages being used within products created by the SCA client firms for the calendar year 2020 (January 1 to December 31, 2020). 4\n\nThe Census project standardized package names based on the naming system of libraries.io -  a  widely  used  site  maintained  by  Tidelift  that  organizes  information  about  more  than  eight million open source packages. The Census focused on the top 2,000 packages based on usage\n\n1 The precise methodologies for the data collection and aggregation are detailed in the Census report by Nagle et al (2022).\n\n2 OSS usage licenses vary a great deal and while some licenses are very open and allow the code to be reused in any manner, including within proprietary code that will be made available for sale at a non-zero price, other licenses restrict reuse to only be allowed if the resultant code is released under the same OSS license (known as copyleft). A detailed discussion of OSS licenses can be found in Lerner and Tirole (2005) and Almeida et al (2017).\n\n3 Indirect OSS usage is captured by dependency analysis and is necessary to accurately measure the full breadth of the OSS a firm relies on. For example, if a firm's proprietary code calls OSS package A, but package A, in turn, calls package B, then only looking at the direct calls would miss that package B was a required building block for the firm's proprietary code.\n\n4 The Census defines an OSS package as 'a unit of software that can be installed and managed by a package manager,' and  defines  a  package  manager  as  'software  that  automates  the  process  of  installing  and  otherwise  managing packages' (Nagle et al, 2022).\n\nreported from the three of the most prominent SCA vendors to identify the most widely used OSS rather  than  the  long-tail  of  the  usage  distribution.  This  led  to  packages  with  less  than  five observations  of  usage  being  dropped.  Since  packages  written  in  the  JavaScript  programming language, and usually hosted on the Node Package Manager (NPM), are generally smaller (fewer lines  of  code)  than  packages  in  other  languages  and  therefore  frequently  have  higher  usage numbers (since developers must include many small packages instead of a few large packages), the Census separately selected the top 1,000 NPM packages and the top 1,000 non-NPM hosted packages.\n\nThis final dataset covers 70% of the total usage of OSS observed in the raw data of the census.   For  each  of  these  2,000  OSS  packages  in  the  Census,  we  identified  the  raw  code 5 maintained on GitHub, the most widely used platform for hosting OSS.  We first attempted to 6 obtain the GitHub repository uniform resource locator (URL) for each package from libraries.io. We were able to match 1,657 packages to repositories via this initial method.  For URLs without 7 a  matching  repository,  we  performed  Google  searches  loosely  following  the  method  in  Singh (2020)."

These SCAs are hired to scan the codebase of a client to gather information on the OSS usage embedded in their proprietary software. This process is often part of the due diligence in mergers and acquisitions to ensure compliance with OSS license agreements.\n\nThe methodology ensures accuracy in several ways:\n\n1. **Direct and Indirect OSS Usage**: The data collection process captures both direct and indirect OSS usage. Direct usage refers to the OSS packages explicitly used in the proprietary software, while indirect usage is captured through dependency analysis. This means that if a proprietary code uses OSS package A, which in turn depends on package B, the methodology ensures that package B's usage is also recorded. This comprehensive approach provides a full picture of the OSS a firm relies on.\n\n2. **Standardization and Focus**: The Census standardized package names using the libraries.io naming system, which organizes information about over eight million open source packages. The focus was on the top 2,000 packages based on usage, as reported by the SCA vendors, to identify the most widely used OSS. This approach avoids the long tail of less frequently used packages, ensuring that the data reflects significant OSS usage.\n\n3. **Exclusion of Low-Usage Packages**: Packages with fewer than five observations of usage were excluded to maintain data quality and relevance. This helps in focusing on packages that have a substantial impact on the software ecosystem.\n\n4. **Separate Selection for JavaScript Packages**: Given that JavaScript packages, often hosted on Node Package Manager (NPM), are generally smaller and more numerous, the Census separately selected the top 1,000 NPM packages and the top 1,000 non-NPM hosted packages. This distinction ensures that the data accurately reflects the usage patterns specific to different programming environments.\n\n5. **Repository Matching**: For each of the 2,000 OSS packages, the Census identified the raw code maintained on GitHub. They initially attempted to match packages to GitHub repositories using libraries.io and supplemented this with Google searches for unmatched URLs. This step ensures that the data is linked to the actual code repositories, providing a reliable source of information.\n\nOverall, the methodology's comprehensive data collection, focus on significant usage, and detailed dependency analysis ensure the accuracy of OSS usage data within proprietary software.",

SCAs are hired to scan the codebase of a client and gather the OSS usage embedded in their proprietary software to ensure they are not violating any OSS license agreements.  Frequently this takes place as part of 2 the due diligence process related to mergers and acquisitions. Unlike other OSS demand measures available from public sources such as package download counts and code changes, the way this data was collected ensures that we observe the precise amount and type of internal OSS usage of the firms. In addition, it allows us to trace the dependencies each package relies on, so that we can observe the indirect OSS usage that is commonly hidden and difficult to obtain.  The result is over 3 2.7 million observations of OSS packages being used within products created by the SCA client firms for the calendar year 2020 (January 1 to December 31, 2020). 4\n\nThe Census project standardized package names based on the naming system of libraries.io -  a  widely  used  site  maintained  by  Tidelift  that  organizes  information  about  more  than  eight million open source packages.

A detailed discussion of OSS licenses can be found in Lerner and Tirole (2005) and Almeida et al (2017).\n\n3 Indirect OSS usage is captured by dependency analysis and is necessary to accurately measure the full breadth of the OSS a firm relies on. For example, if a firm's proprietary code calls OSS package A, but package A, in turn, calls package B, then only looking at the direct calls would miss that package B was a required building block for the firm's proprietary code.\n\n4 The Census defines an OSS package as 'a unit of software that can be installed and managed by a package manager,' and  defines  a  package  manager  as  'software  that  automates  the  process  of  installing  and  otherwise  managing packages' (Nagle et al, 2022).\n\nreported from the three of the most prominent SCA vendors to identify the most widely used OSS rather  than  the  long-tail  of  the  usage  distribution.

Since  packages  written  in  the  JavaScript  programming language, and usually hosted on the Node Package Manager (NPM), are generally smaller (fewer lines  of  code)  than  packages  in  other  languages  and  therefore  frequently  have  higher  usage numbers (since developers must include many small packages instead of a few large packages), the Census separately selected the top 1,000 NPM packages and the top 1,000 non-NPM hosted packages.\n\nThis final dataset covers 70% of the total usage of OSS observed in the raw data of the census.   For  each  of  these  2,000  OSS  packages  in  the  Census,  we  identified  the  raw  code 5 maintained on GitHub, the most widely used platform for hosting OSS.  We first attempted to 6 obtain the GitHub repository uniform resource locator (URL) for each package from libraries.io. We were able to match 1,657 packages to repositories via this initial method.

Without this analysis, firms might overlook critical dependencies that are indirectly used, which can lead to incomplete assessments of their OSS usage and potential licensing obligations.\n\nFor example, consider a firm's proprietary software that directly uses OSS package A. If package A, in turn, depends on package B to function correctly, then package B is also an essential component of the firm's software, even though it is not directly called by the firm's code. Without dependency analysis, the firm might only account for package A in their OSS usage reports, missing the fact that package B is a required building block. This oversight could lead to compliance issues if package B has different licensing terms that need to be adhered to.\n\nThe Census project highlights the importance of capturing these indirect usages to ensure a full and accurate measurement of the OSS a firm relies on. By tracing dependencies, firms can better manage their software composition, ensure compliance with OSS licenses, and understand the full scope of their software's reliance on open source components.",

Methodology\n\nWe first measure the value of OSS by considering the supply and the demand side of OSS using a labor market approach. 14 The thought experiment is that we live in a world where OSS does not exist and has to be recreated at each firm that uses a given piece of OSS. Using the labor market approach, we calculate the labor replacement cost of each OSS package. To estimate the value for each package, we use COCOMO II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) at the individual package level and then sum across all package values to obtain a supply-side labor market replacement value. Then, we scale the supply-side value by the number of times firms are using each package while removing multi-usage within each firm to obtain a demand-side value.\n\nSecond, we move beyond the aggregate and inspect inequality in the value creation process. In OSS, as with many creative endeavors, it is common that a small handful of individuals provide the bulk of the contributions, while many others make small contributions (sometimes referred to as the 80/20 rule, implying 80% of the work is done by 20% of the people). Research has shown these frequent contributors often attain positions of influence in OSS communities as a result of their efforts (Hanisch, et al, 2018). Therefore, to better understand the dispersion of value creation across developers, we first use the GHTorrent data and identify individual developer contributions in two ways: a) through their OSS value contributions directly and b) through the total number of repositories they contributed to. We then test how concentrated these two contribution measures are to better understand whether many or few developers contribute to the total value we measure. We explain the exact details for the labor market approach and the inequality of valuations below.\n\n## 3.1 Labor market approach\n\nFor the labor market approach, we estimate the value of OSS by calculating the replacement value of a package. We ask how much it would cost to reproduce the package by hiring a programmer and paying them a competitive market wage. To estimate this supply-side value ( \ud835\udc49 ! \"#$%&amp; ) , we take the complete list of OSS packages discussed above, and then count the lines of code in each unique\n\n14 In an alternative version, we use a mixture of a labor and goods market approach that is more closely aligned with Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff, et al (2021). However, applying this method in our setting requires numerous additional assumptions due to data constraints. For simplicity we call it the goods market approach for which we provide the details and statistics, as well as the limitations in Appendix A.\n\npackage. 15 For each unique package,  , we calculate the value and then sum over all these values i to obtain the total value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nIn this calculation, we implicitly do not incorporate any production externalities since we assume that there is no spillover knowledge from one package to the next that would lower the cost of programming. 16 This methodology is similar to that used by other papers that estimate the supply-side costs of OSS (Blind et al., 2021; Nagle, 2019b; Robbins et al., 2021)."

            "reference_answer": "The 80/20 rule, also known as the Pareto Principle, is significant in the context of open-source software (OSS) contributions as it highlights the unequal distribution of effort and value creation among developers. According to the document, this rule implies that a small percentage of contributors (around 20%) are responsible for the majority (approximately 80%) of the work or contributions in OSS projects. This pattern is common in many creative endeavors, including OSS, where a few individuals provide the bulk of the contributions.\n\nThe document suggests that this rule impacts the distribution of value creation among developers by indicating that these frequent contributors often attain positions of influence within OSS communities due to their substantial efforts. This concentration of contributions means that a small number of developers are responsible for creating a significant portion of the value in OSS. To better understand this distribution, the document proposes analyzing individual developer contributions in two ways: by their direct OSS value contributions and by the total number of repositories they have contributed to. This analysis helps to determine whether the value creation is concentrated among a few developers or more evenly distributed across many contributors.",

                "Finally, for some analyses we dig deeper and show the top 5 programming languages (as classified by GitHub, 2022 for the year 2020; the year our data is from).

This method is more conservative than other methods of bot detection  like  that  used  in  the  GitHub  Innovation  Graph  (https://innovationgraph.github.com/),  which  rely  on  a monthly commit frequency threshold.\n\n12 https://pypi.org/project/pygount/ and https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist\n\n13 Note that our focus is the cost to recreate OSS code written by humans, not robots.

We also add Go to this list of top languages since it is an increasingly widely used language in OSS.\n\n## 3. Methodology\n\nWe first measure the value of OSS by considering the supply and the demand side of OSS using a labor market approach. 14 The thought experiment is that we live in a world where OSS does not exist and has to be recreated at each firm that uses a given piece of OSS. Using the labor market approach, we calculate the labor replacement cost of each OSS package. To estimate the value for each package, we use COCOMO II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) at the individual package level and then sum across all package values to obtain a supply-side labor market replacement value. Then, we scale the supply-side value by the number of times firms are using each package while removing multi-usage within each firm to obtain a demand-side value.\n\nSecond, we move beyond the aggregate and inspect inequality in the value creation process. In OSS, as with many creative endeavors, it is common that a small handful of individuals provide the bulk of the contributions, while many others make small contributions (sometimes referred to as the 80/20 rule, implying 80% of the work is done by 20% of the people). Research has shown these frequent contributors often attain positions of influence in OSS communities as a result of their efforts (Hanisch, et al, 2018). Therefore, to better understand the dispersion of value creation across developers, we first use the GHTorrent data and identify individual developer contributions in two ways: a) through their OSS value contributions directly and b) through the total number of repositories they contributed to. We then test how concentrated these two contribution measures are to better understand whether many or few developers contribute to the total value we measure. We explain the exact details for the labor market approach and the inequality of valuations below.\n\n## 3.1 Labor market approach\n\nFor the labor market approach, we estimate the value of OSS by calculating the replacement value of a package.

This involves calculating the dollar-value of each open-source software (OSS) package using the Constructive Cost Model II (COCOMO II).

This provides a comprehensive measure of a developer's total contribution to OSS.\n\n3. **Formula Representation**: The individual value contribution from a unique developer, denoted as \\( V_{dev} \\), is expressed using a formula where \\( \\sigma_{dev} \\) is the share of commits the focal developer made in a repository, and \\( V_{repo} \\) is the demand or supply value of the entire repository. The formula takes into account all repositories in the main sample.\n\n4. **Repository Contribution**: This is measured by the number of repositories a given developer contributes to, indicating the variety of OSS needs being addressed by individual developers.

            "reference_answer": "The use of Lorenz curves in the analysis of developer contributions to open-source software (OSS) is significant because they provide a visual representation of inequality in contributions. Lorenz curves are a well-established tool for illustrating the distribution of a particular variable, in this case, the value contributions of developers to OSS. By plotting these curves, the analysis can reveal how evenly or unevenly contributions are distributed among developers.\n\nThe insights provided by Lorenz curves regarding the dispersion of contributions are multifaceted:\n\n1. **Inequality Measurement**: Lorenz curves help quantify the degree of inequality in developer contributions. If the curve is closer to the line of equality (a 45-degree line), it indicates a more equitable distribution of contributions. Conversely, a curve that bows significantly away from the line of equality suggests a high level of inequality, where a small number of developers contribute disproportionately to the total value.\n\n2. **Understanding Concentration**: The curves allow for an assessment of whether the value generated in OSS is concentrated among a few top contributors or more evenly spread across many developers. This is crucial for understanding the dynamics of the OSS ecosystem and whether it relies heavily on a small group of contributors.\n\n3. **Impact on OSS Ecosystem**: By examining the dispersion of contributions, stakeholders can better understand the health and sustainability of the OSS ecosystem. A more equitable distribution might suggest a robust and diverse community, while significant inequality could indicate potential vulnerabilities, such as over-reliance on a few key contributors.\n\n4. **Repository Engagement**: The analysis also considers whether top contributors focus on a narrow set of popular repositories or engage with a broader range of projects. This insight can inform strategies to encourage wider participation and address any imbalances in contribution patterns.\n\nOverall, Lorenz curves provide a clear and informative way to visualize and analyze the distribution of developer contributions, offering valuable insights into the structure and dynamics of the OSS community.",

The average package includes 142 thousand lines of code with a slightly lower average of 113 thousand lines of code for the subset of top languages. When considering the demand (usage) side, we observe that the Census packages were used over 2.7 million times while 92% of this usage is attributable to the top languages. The average package was used 1,472.4 times with a higher usage of around 1,497.5 for the top  languages.  For  the outward-facing  BuiltWith  data  we  find  similar  patterns,  but  at  different  levels.  The  packages included from BuiltWith include over 82 million lines of code, 71% of which are attributable to the  top  programming  languages.  The  average  package  within  the  BuiltWith  sample  has  111 thousand  lines  of  code  with  a  lower  average  of  around  80  thousand  lines  of  code  for  the  top languages. This is because our BuiltWith data primarily consists of JavaScript-based packages, which are often smaller than packages written in other languages. BuiltWith packages were used over 142 thousand times where 99.97% were attributable to the top languages. Next, we used these raw observations to calculate the value of all OSS through the labor market approach and estimated the value created from the supply and demand side.\n\n--- Table 2 about here ---\n\nTable 2 shows the estimates for the value of OSS based on the firm-relevant joint Census and BuiltWith sample. All estimates in Table 2 are based only on software languages classified in bucket  1  from  Table  A1,  which  are  the  most  likely  to  be  written  by  a  human  rather  than  a machine. 19 The first column contains estimates with wages from a low income country (India), the global  average  wage,  and  a  high  income  country  (United  States  of  America),  respectively  (as described above). To reproduce all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the idea of OSS still exists, but all current OSS is deleted and needs to be coded from scratch), using programmers at the average developer wage from India, it would require an investment of $1.22 billion. In contrast, if we use the average developer wage from the United States, then reproducing all widely-used OSS would require  an  investment  of  $6.22  billion.  Using  a  pool  of  programmers  from  across  the  world, weighed based on the existing geographic contributions to OSS as discussed above, would lead to an investment somewhere in between the low and high-income country, $4.15 billion. It is useful to compare these numbers to those from similar studies to understand differences in valuing all OSS (prior studies) versus that which is widely used (our study). Robbins et al. (2021) and Blind et al. (2021) use a method similar to ours and estimate that the value of OSS created in the US is $38 billion in 2019 and that created in the EU is \u20ac1 billion in 2018. Wachs et al. (2022) show that roughly 50% of OSS contributions come from the US and EU combined. In aggregate, that would lead these studies to give a global value of OSS of $78 billion."

The average package includes 142 thousand lines of code, and for the top languages, the average is slightly lower at 113 thousand lines.\n   - **BuiltWith Data:** The BuiltWith data set includes over 82 million lines of code, with 71% attributable to the top programming languages. The average package in this data set has 111 thousand lines of code, and for the top languages, the average is lower at around 80 thousand lines.\n\n   **Differences:** The Census data set has a significantly larger total number of lines of code compared to the BuiltWith data set. The average lines of code per package are also higher in the Census data set. This difference might be due to the nature of the packages included in each data set. The BuiltWith data primarily consists of JavaScript-based packages, which are often smaller in size compared to packages written in other languages, contributing to the lower average lines of code.\n\n2. **Usage Statistics:**\n   - **Census Data:** The packages in the Census data set were used over 2.7 million times, with 92% of this usage attributable to the top languages. The average package was used 1,472.4 times, and for the top languages, the usage was slightly higher at around 1,497.5 times.\n   - **BuiltWith Data:** The BuiltWith packages were used over 142 thousand times, with 99.97% of this usage attributable to the top languages.\n\n   **Differences:** The Census data set shows a much higher total usage count compared to the BuiltWith data set. The higher percentage of usage attributable to the top languages in the BuiltWith data set (99.97%) compared to the Census data set (92%) suggests that the BuiltWith data is more concentrated on the top languages. This could be due to the specific focus of the BuiltWith data on JavaScript-based packages, which are widely used and thus contribute to a higher concentration of usage among the top languages.\n\nOverall, the differences in lines of code and usage statistics between the Census and BuiltWith data sets can be attributed to the types of packages included in each data set and the programming languages they predominantly feature. The Census data set appears to have a broader range of languages and larger packages, while the BuiltWith data set is more focused on smaller, JavaScript-based packages with concentrated usage among the top languages.",

                "The graphical representation in the results section will elucidate the degree of inequality pertaining to the value contributions among developers. To supplement the analysis, we\n\nfurther investigated how dispersed the repository contribution, \ud835\udc41 +./ , is by plotting Equation (8). This enables us to ascertain whether any substantial value inequality stems from top contributors predominantly focusing on a narrow subset of exceptionally popular repositories, or alternatively, from their engagement with a broader spectrum of successful repositories.\n\n## 4. Results\n\nAfter applying the labor market approach using COCOMO II, we obtain global estimates for the value of OSS. To calculate the overall value, we first need the underlying number of lines of code (to calculate the supply-side value) and then the usage statistics (for the demand-side value). Since there may be substantial heterogeneity in value by programming languages, we also show the top programming languages during our investigation period in the year 2020, as discussed above.\n\n## --- Table 1 about here ---\n\nTable  1  shows  descriptive  statistics  from  both  data  sets  separately.  The  inward-facing Census  (Panel  A)  contains  just  over  261.7  million  lines  of  code  with  72%  of  the  lines  being attributable to the top programming languages. The average package includes 142 thousand lines of code with a slightly lower average of 113 thousand lines of code for the subset of top languages. When considering the demand (usage) side, we observe that the Census packages were used over 2.7 million times while 92% of this usage is attributable to the top languages. The average package was used 1,472.4 times with a higher usage of around 1,497.5 for the top  languages.  For  the outward-facing  BuiltWith  data  we  find  similar  patterns,  but  at  different  levels.  The  packages included from BuiltWith include over 82 million lines of code, 71% of which are attributable to the  top  programming  languages.  The  average  package  within  the  BuiltWith  sample  has  111 thousand  lines  of  code  with  a  lower  average  of  around  80  thousand  lines  of  code  for  the  top languages. This is because our BuiltWith data primarily consists of JavaScript-based packages, which are often smaller than packages written in other languages. BuiltWith packages were used over 142 thousand times where 99.97% were attributable to the top languages. Next, we used these raw observations to calculate the value of all OSS through the labor market approach and estimated the value created from the supply and demand side.\n\n--- Table 2 about here ---\n\nTable 2 shows the estimates for the value of OSS based on the firm-relevant joint Census and BuiltWith sample. All estimates in Table 2 are based only on software languages classified in bucket  1  from  Table  A1,  which  are  the  most  likely  to  be  written  by  a  human  rather  than  a machine. 19 The first column contains estimates with wages from a low income country (India), the global  average  wage,  and  a  high  income  country  (United  States  of  America),  respectively  (as described above). To reproduce all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the idea of OSS still exists, but all current OSS is deleted and needs to be coded from scratch), using programmers at the average developer wage from India, it would require an investment of $1.22 billion. In contrast, if we use the average developer wage from the United States, then reproducing all widely-used OSS would require  an  investment  of  $6.22  billion.  Using  a  pool  of  programmers  from  across  the  world, weighed based on the existing geographic contributions to OSS as discussed above, would lead to an investment somewhere in between the low and high-income country, $4.15 billion. It is useful to compare these numbers to those from similar studies to understand differences in valuing all OSS (prior studies) versus that which is widely used (our study). Robbins et al. (2021) and Blind et al. (2021) use a method similar to ours and estimate that the value of OSS created in the US is $38 billion in 2019 and that created in the EU is \u20ac1 billion in 2018. Wachs et al. (2022) show that roughly 50% of OSS contributions come from the US and EU combined. In aggregate, that would lead these studies to give a global value of OSS of $78 billion."

            "reference_answer": "The estimated costs for reproducing all widely-used open-source software (OSS) using developers from different income countries, as shown in Table 2, highlight significant disparities based on geographic wage differences. Using developers from a low-income country like India, the cost is estimated at $1.22 billion. In contrast, using developers from a high-income country like the United States, the cost rises substantially to $6.22 billion. A global pool of developers, weighted by existing geographic contributions, results in an intermediate cost of $4.15 billion.\n\nThese estimates underscore the impact of labor costs on the valuation of OSS. The variation in costs reflects the economic disparities between countries and suggests that the global value of OSS is highly sensitive to the geographic distribution of its contributors. This has implications for how we perceive the economic contribution of OSS globally, as it highlights the potential for cost savings and efficiency gains through international collaboration and leveraging lower-cost labor markets.\n\nWhen compared to previous studies, these estimates are notably lower. For instance, Robbins et al. (2021) and Blind et al. (2021) estimated the value of OSS created in the US alone to be $38 billion in 2019, and Wachs et al. (2022) suggested a global value of $78 billion. The discrepancy between these figures and the current study's estimates may be due to differences in methodology, such as focusing on widely-used OSS versus all OSS, or variations in the scope of what is considered OSS.\n\nThis comparison suggests that the global value of OSS might be underestimated if only direct reproduction costs are considered. The broader economic impact, including innovation, collaboration, and the enabling of other technologies, likely contributes to a much higher intrinsic value. The findings emphasize the importance of considering both the direct and indirect contributions of OSS to the global economy, as well as the role of international collaboration in maximizing its value.",

If we assume this is a consistent ratio for the rest of the world, then the total amount firms spent on software being used in 2020 was $3.4 trillion (= $1.54 trillion/0.45). Combining this rough estimate with the demand side estimate of the value of OSS based on an average global wage ($8.8 trillion), this indicates firms would spend $12.2 trillion (=$3.4 trillion + $8.8 trillion), or three and a half times what they currently spend if they needed to pay in-house developers to write the OSS that they currently use for free.\n\n## --- Figure 1 about here ---\n\nFigure 1 shows the heterogeneity of the value of OSS across the top programming languages.

Conclusion\n\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith. We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average value and distributed it across industries.\n\nIn this study we estimate the value of widely-used open source software globally with two unique datasets: the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data. We are able to estimate not only the supply side value of existing code (e.g., the cost it would take to rewrite each piece of widely-used OSS once) but also the demand side value for the private economy (e.g., the cost it would take for each company that uses a piece of OSS to rewrite it). While we do not focus on the long tail of OSS, we consider this an additional contribution of our study as focusing on OSS that is widely used allows us to more precisely understand the value created by OSS, rather than only measuring the  replacement  cost  for  all  OSS  (which  would  overestimate  the  true  value  since  many  OSS projects are not used in production code). However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n\nAdjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.  We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves."

In the context of open source software (OSS), the Lorenz curve is used to understand the distribution of supply and demand-side values among programmers.\n\nIn the study, the Lorenz curve is applied to both the supply side (Panel A) and the demand side (Panel B) of OSS. A Lorenz curve that lies directly on the 45-degree line would indicate a perfectly even distribution of values across programmers, meaning each programmer contributes equally to the total value. However, the study shows that the Lorenz curve for OSS is nearly flat for most of its length, with a drastic increase for the final share of programmers. This indicates a highly uneven distribution of value, where a small number of programmers contribute disproportionately to the total value.\n\nSpecifically, the curve illustrates that the last five percent of programmers generate over 93% of the supply side value and over 96% of the demand side value. This concentration of value among a small group of programmers suggests that a few individuals are responsible for creating the bulk of OSS code that is heavily relied upon by firms. Additionally, the rise in the number of repositories for the last 10-15% of programmers indicates that these contributors are not only creating highly valuable repositories but are also contributing to a substantial number of repositories.\n\nOverall, the Lorenz curve highlights the significant concentration of value among a small fraction of programmers, emphasizing the critical role these individuals play in the OSS ecosystem.

For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average value and distributed it across industries.\n\nIn this study we estimate the value of widely-used open source software globally with two unique datasets: the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data. We are able to estimate not only the supply side value of existing code (e.g., the cost it would take to rewrite each piece of widely-used OSS once) but also the demand side value for the private economy (e.g., the cost it would take for each company that uses a piece of OSS to rewrite it). While we do not focus on the long tail of OSS, we consider this an additional contribution of our study as focusing on OSS that is widely used allows us to more precisely understand the value created by OSS, rather than only measuring the  replacement  cost  for  all  OSS  (which  would  overestimate  the  true  value  since  many  OSS projects are not used in production code). However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n\nAdjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.  We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves."

            "reference_answer": "The demand-side value of open source software (OSS) varies significantly across different industries. The industries with the highest usage value are 'Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services,' 'Retail Trade,' and 'Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services,' with usage values of approximately $43 billion, $36 billion, and $35 billion, respectively. These industries likely have high usage values because they are service-oriented and heavily rely on software to enhance their operations, improve efficiency, and deliver services.\n\nIn contrast, classical non-service sector industries such as 'Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction,' 'Utilities,' and 'Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing, and Hunting' constitute a smaller portion of the demand-side value of OSS. These industries are traditionally less dependent on software because their core activities are more focused on physical processes and resource extraction rather than digital or service-based operations. As a result, software plays a less significant role in their day-to-day functions, leading to a smaller demand-side value of OSS in these sectors.",

            "reference_answer": "The concept of demand-side value in the context of Open Source Software (OSS) refers to the economic value generated by the use and application of OSS by programmers and organizations. This value is substantial, amounting to $8.8 trillion when considering programmers globally. However, this value is not directly measurable in traditional economic terms because OSS is typically available for free, making its price zero, and the quantity of its use is difficult to quantify with public data alone.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the substantial heterogeneity in the demand-side value of OSS across different programming languages and industries:\n\n1. **Programming Languages**: The demand-side value varies significantly across programming languages. The top six programming languages account for 84% of the total demand-side value. This suggests that certain languages are more widely used or more critical in creating valuable software solutions, whether for internal company use or for products sold to customers.\n\n2. **Inward vs. Outward-Facing Code**: The value also differs based on whether the OSS is used for inward-facing purposes (creating products for sale) or outward-facing purposes (such as enhancing a company's website). This distinction affects how the software contributes to a company's operations and revenue generation.\n\n3. **Industries**: Different industries have varying levels of reliance on OSS, leading to heterogeneity in its value. Some industries may depend more heavily on software solutions, thus deriving greater value from OSS.\n\n4. **Programmer Contributions**: There is a significant disparity in the value contributions by individual programmers. Over 95% of the demand-side value is generated by just five percent of programmers. These high-value contributors often work on a larger number of projects and on more widely used OSS projects compared to those at the lower end of the value distribution.\n\nOverall, the demand-side value of OSS is influenced by the specific applications and contexts in which it is used, the skills and contributions of individual programmers, and the strategic importance of software in different industries.",

            "reference_answer": "The context information highlights that over 95% of the demand-side value of Open Source Software (OSS) is generated by only five percent of programmers. This indicates a significant concentration of value creation among a small group of highly skilled or prolific contributors. These programmers are not only contributing to a few widely used projects but are also involved in a substantially larger number of projects compared to those at the lower end of the value distribution.\n\nThe implications of this distribution are multifaceted:\n\n1. **Skill and Expertise Concentration**: The concentration of value creation suggests that a small group of programmers possess exceptional skills, expertise, or influence within the OSS community. This could lead to a form of meritocracy where the most capable individuals drive the most significant innovations and improvements in OSS.\n\n2. **Innovation and Quality**: With a small percentage of programmers contributing to a large portion of the value, the quality and innovation of OSS projects may be higher. These programmers likely have a deep understanding of the software and can implement more effective and efficient solutions.\n\n3. **Economic Impact**: The substantial value generated by this small group of programmers underscores the critical role they play in the economy. Their contributions to OSS can lead to cost savings, increased productivity, and innovation across various industries, thereby amplifying the economic impact of OSS.\n\n4. **Inequality in Contribution**: This distribution also highlights potential inequalities in contribution and recognition within the OSS community. While a few programmers are responsible for most of the value, many others may not have the same opportunities or resources to contribute at a similar level.\n\n5. **Community Dynamics**: The OSS community may need to address the potential risks of over-reliance on a small group of contributors. Encouraging broader participation and diversifying the contributor base could help mitigate these risks and ensure the sustainability of OSS projects.\n\n6. **Policy and Support**: Policymakers and organizations might consider providing support and resources to nurture and expand the pool of high-value contributors. This could involve education, training, and incentives to encourage more programmers to engage with OSS.\n\nOverall, the concentration of value creation among a small percentage of programmers has significant implications for the distribution of contributions and the overall impact on the economy. It highlights the importance of recognizing and supporting these key contributors while also fostering a more inclusive and diverse OSS community.",

This makes it difficult to assess its value using traditional economic metrics that rely on price and quantity. Additionally, the quantity of OSS is hard to measure using public data alone, as OSS contributions and usage are distributed across numerous platforms and repositories, often without centralized tracking or reporting mechanisms.\n\nThe research highlighted in the context addresses these challenges by focusing on the demand-side value of OSS, which is estimated to be $8.8 trillion when considering programmers from around the world. This approach accounts for the value generated by OSS in terms of its utility and impact on productivity, rather than its market price. The study also identifies substantial heterogeneity in the value of OSS across different programming languages, industries, and the roles of programmers, with a small percentage of programmers contributing to a significant portion of the demand-side value.\n\nBy quantifying the economic impact of OSS in this manner, the research lays the groundwork for future studies in IT by providing a framework to evaluate the broader economic contributions of software that do not fit into traditional economic models. It highlights the importance of considering non-monetary factors, such as innovation, technological independence, and productivity enhancements, when assessing the impact of IT on the global economy.

It provides substantial value by enabling businesses and developers to build and maintain web services without incurring the costs associated with proprietary software. This contribution is not always captured in economic statistics because the software is freely available and does not generate direct revenue. However, it supports a vast ecosystem of internet services and applications, indirectly contributing to economic productivity and innovation.\n\nGreenstein and Nagle's work emphasizes the importance of recognizing and understanding these hidden contributions to better appreciate the full economic impact of open-source software and similar digital resources.",

            "reference_answer": "The article \"Open Source Is Eating Software FASTER than Software Is Eating The World\" suggests that open source software (OSS) is having a significant impact on the global software industry. The implications of this trend are multifaceted:\n\n1. **Increased Collaboration and Innovation**: Open source software encourages collaboration among developers from different backgrounds and organizations. This collaborative environment fosters innovation as developers can build upon each other's work, leading to faster advancements and improvements in software technology.\n\n2. **Cost Efficiency**: OSS reduces costs for companies as they can leverage existing open source solutions instead of developing software from scratch. This cost efficiency allows businesses to allocate resources to other areas, such as research and development or customer service.\n\n3. **Flexibility and Customization**: Open source software provides users with the flexibility to modify and customize the software to meet their specific needs. This adaptability is a significant advantage over traditional software, which often comes with limitations on customization.\n\n4. **Community Support and Security**: The open source community often provides robust support and frequent updates, which can enhance the security and reliability of the software. The collective scrutiny by a large number of developers can lead to quicker identification and resolution of vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Disruption of Traditional Models**: The rise of OSS challenges the traditional proprietary software development model, which relies on closed-source code and licensing fees. Companies that have traditionally depended on proprietary software may need to adapt their business models to remain competitive.\n\nIn comparison to the traditional software development model, open source software represents a shift towards more open, collaborative, and cost-effective approaches. While traditional models focus on proprietary control and monetization through licensing, OSS emphasizes community-driven development and shared resources. This trend is reshaping the software industry by democratizing access to technology and enabling more rapid innovation.",

            "reference_answer": "Table 2 presents the labor-market value of open source software (OSS) under three different wage scenarios: low, global, and high. These scenarios reflect varying average wages for programmers, with the low wage scenario based on the Indian average wage, the high wage scenario based on the US average wage, and the global wage scenario representing a weighted average from various countries.\n\n1. **Labor Supply vs. Labor Demand**:\n   - Across all wage scenarios, the labor demand value significantly exceeds the labor supply value. This indicates a strong market demand for open source software development, suggesting that the economic value generated by OSS is much higher than the cost of labor required to produce it.\n\n2. **Low Wage Scenario**:\n   - Labor Supply: $1.22 Billion\n   - Labor Demand: $2.59 Trillion\n   - The disparity between supply and demand is vast, highlighting that even at lower wage levels, the demand for OSS far outstrips the supply. This suggests that OSS is highly valued in the market, potentially due to its cost-effectiveness and widespread applicability.\n\n3. **Global Wage Scenario**:\n   - Labor Supply: $4.15 Billion\n   - Labor Demand: $8.80 Trillion\n   - The global wage scenario shows a more balanced but still significant gap between supply and demand. This scenario reflects a more realistic average wage, indicating that the global market still places a high value on OSS relative to the cost of labor.\n\n4. **High Wage Scenario**:\n   - Labor Supply: $6.22 Billion\n   - Labor Demand: $13.18 Trillion\n   - Even at the high wage level, the demand for OSS remains more than double the supply value. This suggests that in high-wage economies, the value derived from OSS is substantial, possibly due to the advanced technological infrastructure and higher productivity levels.\n\n**Implications**:\n- The consistent gap between labor supply and demand across all scenarios underscores the economic importance of OSS. It suggests that investments in OSS development can yield high returns, making it an attractive area for both public and private sector investment.\n- The high demand relative to supply may also indicate potential opportunities for programmers and developers to enter the OSS market, as there is a clear need for more labor to meet market demands.\n- Policymakers and educational institutions might consider focusing on developing skills related to OSS to capitalize on this demand, potentially leading to job creation and economic growth.\n- The differences in values across wage scenarios highlight the global nature of OSS, where contributions from various countries can significantly impact the overall market value. This suggests a need for international collaboration and support for OSS initiatives.",

            "reference_answer": "The Lorenz curve is a graphical representation used to illustrate the distribution of a particular variable, often income or wealth, across a population. In the context provided, the Lorenz curve is used to depict the distribution of labor market value contribution per developer and the number of repositories that a fraction of programmers contributed to.\n\nThe significance of the Lorenz curve in this context lies in its ability to show the inequality or concentration of contributions among developers in the open source software (OSS) market. A Lorenz curve that bows significantly away from the line of equality (a 45-degree line) indicates a high level of inequality, meaning that a small number of developers contribute a large portion of the labor market value or are involved in a large number of repositories.\n\nIn relation to the supply and demand sides of the OSS market:\n\n1. **Supply Side**: The Lorenz curve can illustrate how the contributions of developers (in terms of lines of code or repositories) are distributed. A more unequal distribution might suggest that a few developers are responsible for a significant portion of the codebase, which could indicate a concentration of skills or expertise among a small group of contributors.\n\n2. **Demand Side**: On the demand side, the Lorenz curve can reflect how the labor market values these contributions. If the labor market value is also concentrated among a few developers, it suggests that these developers are highly valued, possibly due to their expertise or the critical nature of their contributions to important projects.\n\nOverall, the Lorenz curve provides insights into the distribution of contributions and their valuation in the OSS market, highlighting potential disparities in how labor is supplied and valued. This can inform discussions on the sustainability and inclusivity of the OSS ecosystem, as well as the economic dynamics at play in the labor market for open source software development.",

            "reference_answer": "CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, plays a crucial role in web development by providing the styling and layout for web pages. It is used to control the visual presentation of HTML elements, allowing developers to separate content from design. This separation makes it easier to maintain and update the look and feel of a website without altering the underlying HTML structure.\n\nCSS interacts with HTML and JavaScript to create dynamic and visually appealing web pages in the following ways:\n\n1. **HTML Integration**: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to structure the content of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. CSS complements HTML by defining how these elements should be displayed, including their colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. This allows developers to create consistent and attractive designs across different pages.\n\n2. **JavaScript Interaction**: JavaScript is a programming language used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. CSS can be manipulated by JavaScript to change styles dynamically in response to user actions or other events. For example, JavaScript can be used to change the color of a button when it is clicked or to animate elements on the page. This interaction between CSS and JavaScript enhances the user experience by making web pages more engaging and responsive.\n\nTogether, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript form the core technologies for building modern web applications. HTML provides the structure, CSS handles the styling, and JavaScript adds interactivity, allowing developers to create rich, dynamic web experiences.",

            "reference_answer": "Three programming languages from Bucket 1 that are used for scripting or web development are:\n\n1. **JavaScript**: Although not explicitly listed in the provided context, JavaScript is commonly associated with web development. It is primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic content on websites. JavaScript runs in the browser and is essential for client-side scripting, enabling features like form validation, animations, and asynchronous content updates.\n\n2. **TypeScript**: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. It is used for developing large-scale web applications, providing developers with tools to catch errors early through type checking. TypeScript is often used in conjunction with frameworks like Angular to build robust and maintainable web applications.\n\n3. **VBScript**: VBScript is a scripting language developed by Microsoft, primarily used for automation of tasks in Windows environments. While it is not as commonly used for web development today, it was historically used for client-side scripting in Internet Explorer to enhance web pages with interactive features.\n\nThese languages are integral to web development, with JavaScript and TypeScript being particularly prominent in modern web application development.",

We identify several OSS packages that have similar closed-source, pecuniary alternatives and consider the costs if all commercial users of the free OSS had to replace that software with a pecuniary alternative (similar to the calculations Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) performed for web servers). We can then use this alternate value of p , combined with the q values from above to estimate a goods replacement value of OSS. This method builds on suggestions from Nordhaus (2006, p. 146) who says '\u2026the price of market and nonmarket goods and services should be imputed on the basis of the comparable market goods and services.' We do not expect the estimates from the two methods to be similar. Quite the contrary, the value of those two methods varies substantially since the latter goods-market approach assumes a fixed price to sell a good multiple times and that fixed price is usually lower than the total value estimated from recreating all packages on the labor side. The differential between these estimates is  essentially the result of a firm stepping in to reproduce the missing OSS packages and then selling them for a pecuniary price rather than all firms needing to reproduce those packages from scratch themselves."

            "reference_answer": "The labor-market value and goods-market value approaches for estimating the value of open source software (OSS) differ primarily in their methodologies, assumptions, and outcomes.\n\n1. **Labor-Market Value Approach:**\n   - **Methodology:** This approach estimates the value of OSS by considering the labor costs that would be incurred if the software had to be recreated from scratch. It uses wage data to calculate the cost of labor required to develop the software.\n   - **Assumptions:** It assumes that the value of OSS is equivalent to the cost of the labor needed to produce it. This method considers different wage scenarios (low, global, and high) to reflect variations in labor costs across different regions.\n   - **Outcomes:** The labor-market value tends to be higher because it accounts for the total cost of recreating the software, which includes all the labor inputs. This approach reflects the potential cost savings for firms that use OSS instead of developing proprietary alternatives.\n\n2. **Goods-Market Value Approach:**\n   - **Methodology:** This approach estimates the value of OSS by comparing it to the cost of equivalent proprietary software. It considers the price that would be paid if users had to replace OSS with commercial alternatives.\n   - **Assumptions:** It assumes that the value of OSS is equivalent to the market price of similar proprietary software. This method uses a fixed price for the proprietary alternatives, which is typically lower than the total labor cost of creating the software.\n   - **Outcomes:** The goods-market value is generally lower because it reflects the cost of purchasing a commercial alternative rather than the cost of developing the software from scratch. This approach highlights the savings for users who choose OSS over buying proprietary software.\n\nIn summary, the labor-market value approach focuses on the cost of labor to recreate OSS, leading to higher value estimates, while the goods-market value approach focuses on the cost of replacing OSS with proprietary software, resulting in lower value estimates. The two methods differ in their assumptions about how value is derived\u2014either through labor costs or market prices\u2014and consequently, they produce different outcomes.",

This suggests that the inclusion of more languages broadens the scope and value of open source software in the labor market.\n\n- **Wage Scenarios:** \n  - The labor supply and demand values increase as the wage scenario shifts from low to high. This indicates that higher wages, such as those based on the US average, result in a greater estimated value of open source contributions in the labor market.\n  - The increase in labor demand is more pronounced than the increase in labor supply when moving from low to high wage scenarios, highlighting a larger gap between supply and demand at higher wage levels.\n\nOverall, the data suggests that the inclusion of more languages (buckets 1, 2, and 3) and higher wage scenarios both contribute to a substantial increase in the estimated labor market value of open source software.",

We identify several OSS packages that have similar closed-source, pecuniary alternatives and consider the costs if all commercial users of the free OSS had to replace that software with a pecuniary alternative (similar to the calculations Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) performed for web servers). We can then use this alternate value of p , combined with the q values from above to estimate a goods replacement value of OSS. This method builds on suggestions from Nordhaus (2006, p. 146) who says '\u2026the price of market and nonmarket goods and services should be imputed on the basis of the comparable market goods and services.' We do not expect the estimates from the two methods to be similar. Quite the contrary, the value of those two methods varies substantially since the latter goods-market approach assumes a fixed price to sell a good multiple times and that fixed price is usually lower than the total value estimated from recreating all packages on the labor side. The differential between these estimates is  essentially the result of a firm stepping in to reproduce the missing OSS packages and then selling them for a pecuniary price rather than all firms needing to reproduce those packages from scratch themselves."

            "reference_answer": "Table A5 highlights a range of open source software alternatives to proprietary software, showcasing the diversity and capability of open source solutions in various domains. The significance of having these open source alternatives lies in several key areas:\n\n1. **Cost Savings**: Open source software is typically free to use, which can lead to significant cost savings for individuals and organizations compared to purchasing proprietary software licenses. This is particularly beneficial for startups, educational institutions, and non-profits with limited budgets.\n\n2. **Flexibility and Customization**: Open source software allows users to modify and customize the code to better fit their specific needs. This flexibility is often not available with proprietary software, which can be more rigid and less adaptable to unique requirements.\n\n3. **Community Support and Collaboration**: Open source projects are often supported by a community of developers and users who contribute to the software's development and improvement. This collaborative environment can lead to rapid innovation and problem-solving, as well as a wealth of shared knowledge and resources.\n\n4. **Transparency and Security**: The open nature of the source code allows for greater transparency, enabling users to inspect the code for security vulnerabilities and ensure that the software behaves as expected. This can lead to more secure software, as issues can be identified and addressed by the community.\n\n5. **Avoidance of Vendor Lock-in**: Open source software reduces dependency on a single vendor, allowing users to avoid being locked into a specific ecosystem or facing challenges if a vendor discontinues a product or changes its terms of service.\n\nThe availability of these open source options can significantly impact the software market and user choices in several ways:\n\n- **Increased Competition**: The presence of robust open source alternatives can drive competition in the software market, pushing proprietary software vendors to innovate and improve their offerings to maintain market share.\n\n- **Empowerment of Users**: Users have more choices and can select software that best meets their needs without being constrained by cost or vendor limitations. This empowerment can lead to more diverse and tailored software solutions across different sectors.\n\n- **Encouragement of Open Standards**: The adoption of open source software can promote the use of open standards, facilitating interoperability and integration between different software systems and platforms.\n\nOverall, the availability of open source software alternatives provides significant benefits to users and can lead to a more dynamic and competitive software market.",

            "reference_answer": "Expanding the goods market approach to value open-source software (OSS) across multiple types of software presents several challenges and limitations compared to focusing on a single type like web servers. One primary challenge is the diversity and complexity of OSS, which encompasses a wide range of software types, each with unique functionalities and features. This diversity makes it difficult to identify proprietary equivalents that accurately represent the OSS products in terms of function and feature set.\n\nThe methodology requires creating a basket of proprietary substitutes for OSS, which involves subjective judgment about the popularity and equivalence of OSS products. This subjective perception can introduce bias and variability in the selection process, potentially affecting the accuracy and representativeness of the basket.\n\nData limitations play a significant role in this context. There is no readily available database for proprietary equivalents of OSS, necessitating a manual search for closed-source substitutes. This lack of comprehensive data makes it challenging to ensure that the selected proprietary software accurately reflects the OSS products' market value. Additionally, the absence of proprietary code means that researchers must rely on proxy measures, such as the COCOMO labor supply-side value, to estimate the cost of developing proprietary software from scratch. This reliance on proxies can introduce further inaccuracies and uncertainties in the valuation process.\n\nMoreover, expanding the approach to multiple types of software increases the complexity of the analysis, as each type of software may have different market dynamics, pricing structures, and depreciation rates. These factors can complicate the calculation of average prices and labor supply-side values, making it inherently more difficult to obtain a consistent and reliable valuation across diverse software categories.\n\nOverall, the challenges and limitations of expanding the goods market approach to value OSS across multiple types of software are primarily driven by the diversity of OSS, subjective selection processes, and significant data limitations, all of which contribute to the complexity and potential inaccuracies in the valuation methodology.",

Instead of a pure goods-market approach, this requires assistance from the labor-market approach in terms of scaling for the estimate, which ultimately leads to a substantial underestimate of the value of OSS. Further, the pricing strategy of the proprietary software counterparts is sensitive to the  market  demand.  With  the  goods-market  approach  extending  to  multiple  goods,  the  strong implicit assumption is that the market demands for our basket software and our sample OSS are similar, so they lead to commensurate prices.\n\nAn alternative and even more simplified goods-market back-of-the-envelope calculation that does not account for lines of code and relies on no scaling from the labor market approach would simply be to multiply a price of a reference good with the usage. We can take the minimum, average, and maximum prices of the basket of proprietary goods as captured in the reference price vector p = (69.99, 1610.17, 5800) and simply multiply it with usage from the combined Census and BuiltWith sample (Table 1).

However,  while  this estimate creates slightly more variance than the labor market approach, it is inherently flawed by simply assuming that the imputed prices are identical for each open source product based on the reference price.

            "reference_answer": "The goods-market approach to estimating the value of open-source software (OSS) faces several challenges and limitations, as discussed in the context:\n\n1. **Data Limitations**: The approach is constrained by the availability and quality of data. This makes it difficult to accurately assess the market value of OSS, especially when trying to expand the analysis to multiple types of software beyond just web servers.\n\n2. **Assumptions Required**: The goods-market approach requires numerous assumptions, such as the similarity in market demand between proprietary software and OSS. These assumptions can lead to inaccuracies in the valuation.\n\n3. **Depreciation and Pricing Sensitivity**: The method involves using a depreciation factor consistent with IRS rules, which may not fully capture the unique characteristics of OSS. Additionally, the pricing strategy of proprietary software is sensitive to market demand, which may not align with OSS pricing.\n\n4. **Simplified Calculations**: An alternative simplified calculation method, which multiplies a reference good's price by usage, does not account for differences in lines of code or scaling from the labor market. This can result in a wide range of estimated values ($0.2 - $16.5 trillion), indicating high variance and potential inaccuracy.\n\n5. **Comparison Issues**: The approach assumes that the imputed prices for proprietary software are identical for each OSS product, which is flawed. The comparison is likened to \"oranges to apples\" because the proprietary goods are fully functional, stand-alone software packages, whereas OSS packages are often smaller application libraries.\n\nThese challenges impact the accuracy of the valuation by introducing significant variance and potential underestimation of OSS value. The reliance on assumptions and the inherent differences between proprietary and open-source software further complicate the estimation process, leading to less reliable results. As a result, the context suggests placing stronger emphasis on the labor cost approach for a more accurate valuation.",

            "reference_answer": "The labor-market approach plays a crucial role in estimating the value of open source software (OSS) due to the inherent complexities and limitations associated with the goods-market approach. In the context provided, the labor-market approach is emphasized for several reasons:\n\n1. **Data Limitations**: The goods-market approach faces significant constraints due to data limitations, making it difficult to accurately estimate the value of OSS. The labor-market approach, on the other hand, relies on more readily available data related to labor costs, which can provide a more reliable basis for valuation.\n\n2. **Assumptions and Complexity**: The goods-market approach requires numerous assumptions, such as the similarity in market demand for proprietary and open source software, which can lead to substantial underestimates of OSS value. The labor-market approach is less reliant on these assumptions, making it a more straightforward and potentially accurate method.\n\n3. **Nature of OSS**: The goods-market approach involves comparing OSS to proprietary software, which are often fully functional, stand-alone packages. In contrast, OSS often consists of application libraries that are smaller and not directly comparable to these proprietary packages. The labor-market approach sidesteps this issue by focusing on the cost of labor involved in developing OSS, rather than trying to equate it to proprietary software.\n\n4. **Valuation Variance**: The goods-market approach can result in a wide range of valuation estimates, from $0.2 to $16.5 trillion, due to the variability in imputed proprietary prices. This variance highlights the approach's inherent flaws and the difficulty in achieving a precise valuation. The labor-market approach, by focusing on labor costs, provides a more consistent and potentially accurate estimate.\n\nOverall, the context places stronger emphasis on the labor-market approach because it offers a more reliable and less assumption-dependent method for estimating the value of OSS, given the challenges and limitations associated with the goods-market approach.",
