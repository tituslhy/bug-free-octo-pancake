A  pervasive example is open source software (OSS), a global public good that plays a vital role in the economy and is foundational for most technology we use today. However, it is difficult to measure the value of OSS due to its non-pecuniary nature and lack of centralized usage tracking. Therefore, OSS remains largely unaccounted for in economic measures. Although prior studies have estimate...","## 1. Introduction\\n\\nIn 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that &#x27;software is eating the world&#x27; (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that &#x27;open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,&#x27; (Jacks, 2022). Other recent studies have come to similar conclusions showing that open source software  (OSS)  -  software  whose  source  code  is  publicly  available  for  inspection,  us...","## 2. Empirical Setting and Data\\n\\nAlthough the concept of free and open software has existed since the 1950&#x27;s, it became more popular in the 1980&#x27;s due to the efforts of Richard Stallman and his launch of the GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation (Maracke, 2019). However, it was in the 1990&#x27;s that OSS took off after Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel, a now widely adopted OSS operating system (Tozzi, 2016). Today, OSS is considered a key building block of the digital economy and is ...","## 3. Methodology\\n\\nWe first measure the value of OSS by considering the supply and the demand side of OSS using a labor market approach. 14 The thought experiment is that we live in a world where OSS does not exist and has to be recreated at each firm that uses a given piece of OSS. Using the labor market approach, we calculate the labor replacement cost of each OSS package. To estimate the value for each package, we use COCOMO II (Boehm, 1984; Boehm et al., 2009) at the individual package level...","## 3.1 Labor market approach\\n\\nFor the labor market approach, we estimate the value of OSS by calculating the replacement value of a package. We ask how much it would cost to reproduce the package by hiring a programmer and paying them a competitive market wage. To estimate this supply-side value ( \\ud835\\udc49 ! \\"#$%&amp;amp; ) , we take the complete list of OSS packages discussed above, and then count the lines of code in each unique\\n\\n14 In an alternative version, we use a mixture of a labor and goods market ...","## 3.2 Contribution Measurement\\n\\nTo better understand how value is created and whether it is created equally or unequally, we build up a graphical depiction in three steps. In the first step, we measure the value contributions by developers. In a second step, we obtain a measure for the number of repositories developers contribute to. Finally, we provide a graphical representation of both using the commonly known concept of the Lorenz curve to better understand the extent of inequality in contri...","## 4. Results\\n\\nAfter applying the labor market approach using COCOMO II, we obtain global estimates for the value of OSS. To calculate the overall value, we first need the underlying number of lines of code (to calculate the supply-side value) and then the usage statistics (for the demand-side value). Since there may be substantial heterogeneity in value by programming languages, we also show the top programming languages during our investigation period in the year 2020, as discussed above.","## --- Table 1 about here ---\\n\\nTable  1  shows  descriptive  statistics  from  both  data  sets  separately.  The  inward-facing Census  (Panel  A)  contains  just  over  261.7  million  lines  of  code  with  72%  of  the  lines  being attributable to the top programming languages. The average package includes 142 thousand lines of code with a slightly lower average of 113 thousand lines of code for the subset of top languages. When considering the demand (usage) side, we observe that the Censu...","## --- Figure 1 about here ---\\n\\nFigure 1 shows the heterogeneity of the value of OSS across the top programming languages. Panel A shows the supply side value with the labor value being displayed on the vertical axis. We find that OSS packages created in Go have the highest value with $803 million in value that would have to be created from scratch if the OSS packages did not exist. Go is closely followed by JavaScript  and  Java  with  $758  million  and  $658  million,  respectively.  The  val...","## --- Figure 2 about here ---\\n\\nFigure 2 splits the OSS value estimates for each language by our inward facing (Census) and outward facing (BuiltWith) data sources. Panel A and Panel B focus on the supply and demand side estimation for the Census. We obtain a similar pattern that has been established already in the aggregate when pooling both data sources (Figure 1) albeit the impact of JavaScript is substantially lower.  On  the  supply  side  of  the  Census  in  Panel  A,  Java  has  the  sec...","## -- Figure 4 about here ---\\n\\nFigure 3 shows the Lorenz curves and the number of repositories that a fraction of programmers has contributed to for the supply side (Panel A) and the demand side (Panel B). A Lorenz curve that  lay  directly  on  the  45  degree  line  would  imply  a  very  even  distribution  of  values  across programmers. Instead, Panel A shows a Lorenz curve as a nearly flat line with a drastic increase for the final share of programmers. This implies that the distribution o...","## 5. Conclusion\\n\\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith. We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average valu...","## References\\n\\nAlmeida, D. A., Murphy, G. C., Wilson, G., &amp;amp; Hoye, M. (2017, May).

This is achieved by:\\n\\n1. **Counting Lines of Code**: Each unique OSS package&#x27;s lines of code are counted.\\n2. **Using COCOMO II**: The Constructive Cost Model II (COCOMO II) is used to convert these lines of code into dollar values. This model includes non-linear adjustment factors and effort-adjustment parameters to estimate the effort required in person-month units for each project.\\n3. **Applying Global Wage Rates**: The estimated effort is then multiplied by a weighted global wage, which is based on the base monthly salaries of software developers in the top 30 countries by GitHub developer counts.\\n\\nThis methodology assumes no production externalities, meaning there is no spillover knowledge from one package to another that would reduce programming costs.","The authors of \\"The Value of Open Source Software\\" are not explicitly mentioned in the available information.","Under the high wage scenario, the labor-market value of open source using languages in different buckets is as follows:\\n\\n- **Bucket 1**: $6.22 billion for labor supply and $13.18 trillion for labor demand.\\n- **Bucket 2**: $6.26 billion for labor supply and $13.24 trillion for labor demand.\\n- **Bucket 3**: $9.59 billion for labor supply and $17.91 trillion for labor demand.","The two main data sources used to estimate the value of open source software in the Harvard Business School&#x27;s OSS report are:\\n\\n1. **Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries**: This project aggregates data from multiple software composition analysis firms to track widely used OSS in company codebases.\\n\\n2. **BuiltWith dataset**: This dataset provides scans of nearly nine million websites to identify the underlying technology, including OSS libraries, used by these websites.\\n\\nThese datasets complement each other by focusing on different aspects of OSS usage, reducing the chances of double-counting.","Panel A of Figure 3 indicates a highly uneven distribution of supply value among programmers.

This method assumes a scenario where OSS does not exist and must be recreated by a single firm, which then sells it at a price. A basket of equivalent proprietary goods is created to represent the diversity of OSS, and prices for these proprietary equivalents are obtained. The approach uses these prices to estimate the goods-market value of OSS, which is generally lower than the labor market value because the firm can sell the software multiple times at a fixed price.

It estimates how much it would cost to reproduce the package by hiring a programmer and paying them a competitive market wage. The Constructive Cost Model II (COCOMO II) is used to estimate the supply-side value by counting the lines of code in each unique package and converting these into dollar values. The demand-side value is then calculated by scaling the supply-side value based on the number of times firms use each package, while ensuring that multi-usage within each firm is removed. This approach provides a comprehensive view of the value of OSS by considering both the cost to recreate the software and its usage across firms.\\n\\n2. **Goods-Market Valuation Approach**: This method estimates the value of OSS by considering the cost of replacing it with proprietary alternatives. It assumes a scenario where OSS does not exist and must be recreated by a single firm, which then sells it at a price. The approach involves creating a basket of proprietary software that serves as substitutes for OSS, obtaining prices for these proprietary equivalents, and calculating the average price and labor supply-side value for the basket. This method typically results in a lower valuation because it assumes a fixed price for selling the software multiple times. The goods-market approach also considers the demand-side value by estimating the price a firm would charge if it produced and sold all existing widely used OSS. However, due to data limitations and assumptions required, the report places more emphasis on the labor cost approach.","According to Figure 1, the programming language with the highest value on the supply side is Go, with a value of $803 million. The estimated cost to recreate all widely-used open-source software (OSS) using programmers from the United States is $6.22 billion.","The working paper number and identifier associated with the Harvard Business School&#x27;s OSS report is Working Paper 24-038.","The two main data sources used to estimate the value of open source software in the Harvard Business School&#x27;s OSS report are the \\"Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries\\" and the BuiltWith dataset.\\n\\nTo address the potential issue of double-counting, the report removes multi-usage within each firm when scaling the supply-side value by the number of times firms are using each OSS package. This ensures that the demand-side value accurately reflects the unique usage of each package without inflating the value through repeated counts within the same firm.","In the OSS report, the value contribution of a developer to a repository is calculated by determining the developer&#x27;s share of commits relative to the total number of commits for that repository. This share is then multiplied by the repository&#x27;s demand and supply values separately to derive the value-added contribution of the individual developer to the repository. These value contributions are then aggregated across all repositories for each developer.\\n\\nLorenz curves are used in the analysis of developer contributions to graphically examine the dispersion of contribution values among developers. They help represent inequality, allowing for a better understanding of how developer contributions to open-source software (OSS) are distributed in terms of demand and supply values. This analysis helps identify whether the value generated is concentrated within a small number of developers or more evenly distributed across many contributors.","JavaScript holds significant value in the BuiltWith dataset as it is the primary driver of supply-side value and also leads in demand-side value, with TypeScript following as the second most valuable language.

This insight can inform policy makers about the dynamics of OSS development and the potential need for policies supporting equitable contribution and recognition.\\n3. **Concentration of Contributions**: The findings on the concentration of contributions could influence how organizations and communities structure their support and incentives for OSS development.","The report on the value of Open Source Software was authored by Nagle, F., Dana, J., Hoffman, J., Randazzo, S., and Zhou, Y., and it was released in 2022.","The estimated cost to reproduce all widely-used open-source software (OSS) varies depending on the income level of the countries from which programmers are sourced. Using programmers from a low-income country like India, the cost would be approximately $1.22 billion. If using programmers from a high-income country like the United States, the cost would be around $6.22 billion. A more balanced approach, using a global pool of programmers with wages weighted based on existing geographic contributions to OSS, would result in a cost of about $4.15 billion.\\n\\nIn terms of demand-side value, OSS provides significant economic benefits compared to global software revenue and private-sector investment in software. It is estimated that firms would need to spend 3.5 times more on software than they currently do if OSS did not exist. This underscores the substantial economic impact and cost savings that OSS contributes to the global economy.","Examples of configuration languages include:\\n\\n- CMAKE\\n- INI\\n- MAKEFILE\\n- NGINX CONFIGURATION FILE\\n- NSIS\\n- SQUIDCONF\\n- TERRAFORM\\n- TOML\\n\\nTemplate engines mentioned are:\\n\\n- Cheetah\\n- Genshi\\n- Pug\\n- Smarty\\n- Velocity","The two main data sources used to estimate the value of widely-used open source software in the Harvard Business School&#x27;s OSS report are the \\"Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries\\" and the BuiltWith dataset.\\n\\nRegarding the demand-side value of open source software, the report finds that it is significantly larger than the supply-side value, estimated at $8.8 trillion. It highlights that firms would need to spend 3.5 times more on software if open source software did not exist. Additionally, the report notes that the top six programming languages account for 84% of this demand-side value, and 96% of the value is created by only 5% of open source software developers.","The Harvard Business School&#x27;s report estimates the value of open-source software (OSS) using two approaches: the labor market approach and the goods-market valuation approach.\\n\\n1. **Labor Market Approach**: This method estimates the value of OSS by calculating the replacement cost of each OSS package.

It uses a basket of proprietary software equivalents to represent the OSS products and calculates their market prices. The approach assumes a scenario where a single firm reproduces the OSS and sells it at a fixed price, which is typically lower than the total value estimated from recreating all packages using labor costs. This results in a goods-market supply-side value and an equivalent demand-side value, which is generally smaller than the labor demand value due to the profit made by selling the software to multiple customers. Although this method provides an alternative perspective on the economic value of OSS, it is complex and requires several assumptions, leading to a substantial underestimate of the OSS value compared to the labor cost approach.","The Harvard Business School&#x27;s OSS report does not provide specific information about \\"Bucket 1\\" or its contents, nor does it specifically list any mark-up languages.","The authors of the report on the value of open source software are Nagle, F., Dana, J., Hoffman, J., Randazzo, S., and Zhou, Y.

The labor market approach estimates the value by calculating the replacement cost of a package through hiring programmers at competitive wages, using COCOMO II to estimate supply-side value based on lines of code and demand-side value by incorporating usage information, without accounting for externalities.","The study uses two primary data sources: the &#x27;Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries&#x27; and the BuiltWith dataset, with Census II aggregating data from software composition analysis firms and BuiltWith scanning websites for OSS libraries. To estimate the labor replacement value of OSS, the study calculates the labor cost required to recreate an OSS package by measuring lines of code and applying the COCOMO II model to estimate person-hours, using global wage data from Salary Expert to assess the cost if OSS did not exist.","The report measures the value of open source software (OSS) using a labor market approach by calculating the labor replacement cost of each OSS package, estimating the cost to reproduce the package by hiring a programmer and paying them a competitive market wage, and using the COCOMO II model to calculate the supply-side value. The demand-side value is obtained by scaling the supply-side value by the number of times firms are using each package, while removing multi-usage within each firm. The goods-market valuation approach estimates the value of OSS by considering the costs if all commercial users of free OSS had to replace that software with a pecuniary alternative, using a basket of equivalent substitute proprietary goods priced on the open market as a stand-in for an OSS product, assuming a fixed price for a good sold multiple times, which is usually lower than the total value estimated from recreating all packages on the labor side.","According to Figure 1, Go has the highest value on the supply side with $803 million, and recreating all widely-used OSS using programmers from the United States would require an investment of $6.22 billion.","The working paper number and identifier associated with the Harvard Business School&#x27;s OSS report is 24-038.","The two main data sources used are the Census and BuiltWith datasets; the Census data is inward-facing and identifies OSS code in products created by firms, while the BuiltWith data is outward-facing and identifies OSS code that consumers interact with through firm websites. The report addresses the potential issue of double-counting by using these datasets that capture different dimensions of OSS usage, with only a small overlap of 18 packages found in both.","The value contribution of a developer to a repository is calculated by determining their share of commits to the total number of commits for a repository, which is then multiplied with the repository&#x27;s demand and supply values separately to derive the value-added contribution of that individual contributor. These contributions are aggregated across all repositories for each developer. Lorenz curves are used to graphically examine the dispersion of these developer contribution values with respect to both demand and supply side values, helping to understand the inequality and dispersion of developer contributions within the private economy.","In the BuiltWith dataset, JavaScript is significant as it drives the supply side value and generates most of the demand side value, with TypeScript as the second most important language. The industry with the highest demand-side value of open source software is &#x27;Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services,&#x27; with an estimated value of around $43 billion.","The Harvard Business School&#x27;s OSS report highlights the difficulty in assessing the value of open source software due to its non-pecuniary nature and lack of centralized usage tracking, as OSS typically has a price of zero and unknown quantity due to unrestricted copying and reuse. The report contributes to academic literature and policy makers by providing estimates for the value of OSS, introducing methodological advances for studying intangible capital, emphasizing the importance of OSS to firms, and informing policymakers about OSS&#x27;s impact on the global economy.","The authors of the report are Manuel Hoffmann, Frank Nagle, and Yanuo Zhou, and the version of the report was released on January 1, 2024.","To reproduce all widely-used OSS using programmers at the average developer wage from India, it would require an investment of $1.22 billion, while using the average developer wage from the United States, the cost would be $6.22 billion, and using a pool of programmers from across the world, it would lead to an investment of $4.15 billion. The demand-side value of OSS is estimated to be between $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion, depending on the wage level of the programmers used. In comparison, global software revenue in 2020 was $531.7 billion, and private-sector investment in software in the US was $479.2 billion, with $215.5 billion being prepackaged software. Firms would spend $12.2 trillion if they needed to pay in-house developers to write the OSS they currently use for free.","Some examples of configuration languages mentioned are CMAKE, INI, MAKEFILE, NGINX CONFIGURATION FILE, NSIS, SQUIDCONF, TERRAFORM, and TOML, while the template engines listed are CHEETAH, GENSHI, PUG, SMARTY, and VELOCITY.","The two main data sources used in the report are the &#x27;Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries&#x27; and the BuiltWith dataset, which aggregate data from software composition analysis firms and scan websites to identify OSS usage.

Conclusion\\n\\n20 Due to the Census containing proprietary customer information, it did not reveal industries across the whole dataset and as such we can only show the value across industries using the outward-facing data from BuiltWith. We match BuiltWith websites to industry information from the Orbis and Compustat datasets. 94.6% of BuiltWith websites are matched with an industry through this process. For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average valu...","## 4. Results\\n\\nAfter applying the labor market approach using COCOMO II, we obtain global estimates for the value of OSS. To calculate the overall value, we first need the underlying number of lines of code (to calculate the supply-side value) and then the usage statistics (for the demand-side value). Since there may be substantial heterogeneity in value by programming languages, we also show the top programming languages during our investigation period in the year 2020, as discussed above.","## 1. Introduction\\n\\nIn 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that &#x27;software is eating the world&#x27; (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that &#x27;open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,&#x27; (Jacks, 2022).

A  pervasive example is open source software (OSS), a global public good that plays a vital role in the economy and is foundational for most technology we use today. However, it is difficult to measure the value of OSS due to its non-pecuniary nature and lack of centralized usage tracking. Therefore, OSS remains largely unaccounted for in economic measures. Although prior studies have estimate...","## --- Figure 1 about here ---\\n\\nFigure 1 shows the heterogeneity of the value of OSS across the top programming languages. Panel A shows the supply side value with the labor value being displayed on the vertical axis. We find that OSS packages created in Go have the highest value with $803 million in value that would have to be created from scratch if the OSS packages did not exist. Go is closely followed by JavaScript  and  Java  with  $758  million  and  $658  million,  respectively.  The  val...","## Appendix A) Goods-Market Valuation Approach\\n\\nAs an alternate estimation method, instead of using the labor replacement cost, we use a goods replacement value approach. We identify several OSS packages that have similar closed-source, pecuniary alternatives and consider the costs if all commercial users of the free OSS had to replace that software with a pecuniary alternative (similar to the calculations Greenstein and Nagle (2014) and Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) performed for web servers). ...","## Online Appendix\\n\\nTable A1 Languages within each bucket\\n\\n| Type                                      | Language             |\\n|-------------------------------------------|----------------------|\\n| Panel A: Bucket 1 - Languages             |                      |\\n| Mark-Up Language                          | BIBTEX               |\\n| Mark-Up Language                          | COLDFUSION HTML      |\\n| Mark-Up Language                          | DOCBOOK XML          |\\n| Mark-Up Language         ...","## 2.

However, it was in the 1990&#x27;s that OSS took off after Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel, a now widely adopted OSS operating system (Tozzi, 2016).

Methodology\\n\\nWe first measure the value of OSS by considering the supply and the demand side of OSS using a labor market approach. 14 The thought experiment is that we live in a world where OSS does not exist and has to be recreated at each firm that uses a given piece of OSS. Using the labor market approach, we calculate the labor replacement cost of each OSS package.
