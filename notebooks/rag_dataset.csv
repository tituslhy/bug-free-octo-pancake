A  pervasive example is open source software (OSS), a global public good that plays a vital role in the economy and is foundational for most technology we use today. However, it is difficult to measure the value of OSS due to its non-pecuniary nature and lack of centralized usage tracking. Therefore, OSS remains largely unaccounted for in economic measures. Although prior studies have estimated the supply-side costs to recreate this software, a lack of data has hampered estimating the much larger demand-side (usage) value created by OSS. Therefore, to understand the complete economic and social value of widely-used OSS, we leverage unique global data from two complementary sources capturing  OSS  usage  by  millions  of  global  firms.  We  first  estimate  the  supply-side  value  by calculating the cost to recreate the most widely used OSS once. We then calculate the demandside value based on a replacement value for each firm that uses the software and would need to build it internally if OSS did not exist. We estimate the supply-side value of widely-used OSS is $4.15 billion, but that the demand-side value is much larger at $8.8 trillion. We find that firms would need to spend 3.5 times more on software than they currently do if OSS did not exist. The top six programming languages in our sample comprise 84% of the demand-side value of OSS. Further, 96% of the demand-side value is created by only 5% of OSS developers.\n\nJEL Classification:\n\nH4; O3; J0\n\nKeywords: Open-source software, global public good\n\nAcknowledgement: The authors are grateful for  financial  and  administrative  support  from  the Linux  Foundation  without  which  the  data  from  the  Census  would  not  have  otherwise  been available.

Introduction\n\nIn 2011, venture capitalist Mark Andreessen famously argued that 'software is eating the world' (Andreessen, 2011), a sentiment few would argue with today. More recently, venture capitalist Joseph Jacks argued that 'open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,' (Jacks, 2022). Other recent studies have come to similar conclusions showing that open source software  (OSS)  -  software  whose  source  code  is  publicly  available  for  inspection,  use,  and modification and is often created in a decentralized manner and distributed for free - appears in 96% of codebases (Synopsys 2023), and that some commercial software consists of up to 99.9% freely available OSS (Musseau et al., 2022). Although in its early days OSS frequently copied features from existing proprietary software, OSS today includes cutting edge technology in various fields including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, big data, and analytics.  However, despite the increasing importance of OSS to all software (and therefore to the entire economy), measuring its impact has been elusive. Traditionally, to measure the value created by a good or service,  economists  multiply  the  price  ( p )  times  the  quantity  sold  ( q ).  However,  in  OSS, p is generally zero since the source code is publicly available, and q is  unknown due to the limited number of restrictions around how the code may be copied and reused. For example, if a company downloads  a  piece  of  OSS  from  a  public  code  repository,  it  may  copy  it  thousands  of  times internally (legally) and then share it with suppliers or customers (also legally), so public download data is insufficient. Although some recent studies have sought to estimate the value of p (discussed below), data for estimating q has been unavailable or intractable for anything more than just a handful of OSS packages.

This concept can trace its roots as far back as the 4 th -century BC philosopher Aristotle who wrote 'That which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care.

(Aristotle,  1981).

Building on this work, Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for her research highlighting paths to avoiding the tragedy of the commons through community coordination efforts that did not necessitate government enforced laws to manage and guard the commons (Ostrom 1990). The parallels between shared grazing lands and shared digital infrastructure are palpable - the availability of communal grass to feed cattle, and in turn feed people, was critical to the agrarian economy, and the ability to not have to recreate code that someone else has already written is critical to the modern economy. Further, in both contexts, despite knowing grass and code are critical inputs to the economy, measuring their actual value is difficult. And, as the renowned mathematician and physicist Lord Kelvin is believed to have said, 'If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.' And if you cannot improve and maintain it, such common goods may crumble under the weight of their own success as they are overused, but underinvested in (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021). Therefore, measuring the value OSS creates is crucial to the future health of the digital economy, and the rest of the economy that is built on top of it.\n\nImportantly, recent studies have attempted to address these measurement issues but fall short of capturing both the breadth and depth of OSS usage - a gap we seek to fill with this paper. For example, researchers have attempted to gain breadth by using novel methodologies to estimate the labor replacement value of the current corpus of OSS created in the United States at $38 billion in 2019 (Robbins et al., 2021) and that created in the European Union at €1 billion (Blind et al., 2021) by imputing the labor costs that it would have taken to rewrite existing OSS. Such efforts do a very good job at estimating what it would cost to replace all existing OSS if it disappeared tomorrow. However, the resultant estimates rely on two important assumptions. First, that all OSS is equally valuable from a usage standpoint, and second that the concept of OSS would still exist, and society would just need to rewrite the code once, thus addressing the aforementioned problem of a missing value for p , but not addressing the missing value of q . In a world where OSS did not exist at all, then each piece of OSS software would not need to be rewritten just once, but instead would need to be rewritten by every firm that used the software (assuming the firm could freely share the software within its boundaries). Other research (Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; MurcianoGoroff, Zhuo, and Greenstein, 2021) has gone deeper into this hypothetical, albeit in a narrow\n\nmanner, by only focusing on web servers (which are public facing on the Internet and can therefore be readily measured). Using different methods, both studies measure q for this one type of software and impute p by using a goods replacement value approach based on the prices for closed-source alternatives offered by firms. With data from the United States the resulting estimates show a value of  $2  billion  for  the  OSS  Apache  Web  Server  in  2012  (Greenstein  and  Nagle,  2014)  and  a combined value of $4.5 billion for Apache and the increasingly popular OSS web server nginx in 2018 (Murciano-Goroff, et al., 2021).

The first is the 'Census II of Free and Open Source Software - Application Libraries' (Nagle et al., 2022).""]","The concept of the ""tragedy of the commons"" relates to the challenges faced in measuring the value of open-source software (OSS) by highlighting the potential for overuse and underinvestment in shared resources. In the context of OSS, the ""commons"" refers to the shared digital infrastructure and code that many individuals and organizations rely on. Just as shared grazing lands can be overused by cattle herders, OSS can be overutilized by firms without adequate investment in its maintenance and improvement.

The implications for the digital economy are significant. OSS is a critical input to the modern economy, much like communal grass was to the agrarian economy. However, measuring the actual value of OSS is challenging, which complicates efforts to ensure its sustainability. If the value of OSS is not properly measured and understood, it may lead to insufficient investment in its development and maintenance, risking the stability and growth of the digital economy that depends on it.

Efforts to measure the value of OSS, such as estimating the labor replacement value, have been made but often fall short of capturing the full scope of its usage and impact. This gap in measurement can hinder the ability to improve and maintain OSS, potentially leading to a situation where the resource crumbles under its own success due to overuse and underinvestment. Therefore, accurately measuring the value of OSS is crucial for the future health of the digital economy and the broader economy built upon it.",ai (gpt-4o),ai (gpt-4o)
7,"**Answer:** The ""tragedy of the commons"" refers to the overuse and underinvestment in shared resources, as individuals prioritize their own benefits over the collective good. This concept is applicable to open-source software (OSS) because, like shared grazing lands, OSS is a communal resource that is critical to the economy. However, its value is difficult to measure, which can lead to overuse and underinvestment. If the value of OSS is not accurately measured and maintained, it risks crumbling under its own success, similar to the tragedy of the commons. This has significant implications for the digital economy, as OSS is a foundational element that supports various economic activities. Therefore, accurately measuring the value of OSS is crucial to ensure its sustainability and the health of the broader economy.","[""Men pay most attention to what is their own and care less for what is common.'  (Aristotle,  1981).  William  Forster  Lloyd  (1833)  resurfaced  the  idea  in  modern economic thought by highlighting the example of shared tracts of land used for cattle grazing by\n\nmultiple cattle herders who each had an incentive to overuse the shared resource. Garrett Hardin (1968)  brought  the  concept  into  the  broader  zeitgeist  when  he  wrote  an  article  discussing  the problem entitled 'The Tragedy of the Commons.' Building on this work, Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for her research highlighting paths to avoiding the tragedy of the commons through community coordination efforts that did not necessitate government enforced laws to manage and guard the commons (Ostrom 1990). The parallels between shared grazing lands and shared digital infrastructure are palpable - the availability of communal grass to feed cattle, and in turn feed people, was critical to the agrarian economy, and the ability to not have to recreate code that someone else has already written is critical to the modern economy. Further, in both contexts, despite knowing grass and code are critical inputs to the economy, measuring their actual value is difficult. And, as the renowned mathematician and physicist Lord Kelvin is believed to have said, 'If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.'

While prior estimates of the value of OSS only went either broad (estimating the supply-side costs of a large swath of OSS) or deep (estimating the value created by one particular type of OSS), this study does both by using unique datasets that allow for a better understanding of the breadth and depth of OSS usage. Further, rather than measuring the value of all OSS, this study focuses on the value of OSS that is used by firms\n\nto create its products and websites, limiting the measurement error occurring in studies that are unable to account for which OSS is actually used in production. This contribution builds upon, and extends, important research (e.g., Blind et al., 2021; Greenstein and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021; Robbins et al., 2021) that has sought to identify the value of this vital resource that contributes a great deal to the modern economy despite the difficulties measuring this contribution. In  doing  so,  it  adds  insights  to  a  long-running  discussion  related  to  the  impact  of  information technology (IT) on productivity (Brynjolfsson, 1993; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 1996; Nagle, 2019a; Solow, 1987) known as the 'productivity paradox' where IT investments can have limited impact on productivity statistics.

However, it was in the 1990's that OSS took off after Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel, a now widely adopted OSS operating system (Tozzi, 2016). Today, OSS is considered a key building block of the digital economy and is widely used by software developers in everything from phones to cars to refrigerators to cutting-edge AI (Lifshitz-Assaf and Nagle, 2021).\n\nWe use two complementary main data sources to estimate the value of OSS. The first is the Census and is inward facing. It allows us to identify OSS code that goes into products that firms create. The second dataset is BuiltWith and is outward facing, allowing us to identify OSS code  that  consumers  directly  interact  with  through  firm  websites.  Since  the  raw  data  in  both datasets only contains package names, version numbers, and package manager names, and does not  contain  any  source  code  related  information,  we  first  obtain  the  publicly  accessible  code repository for each package which includes package-level information including the lines of code and  the  programming  languages  used.  One  may  worry  about  double-counting  for  the  value calculations as a result of using two separate datasets. However, the overlap of both the Census and  the  BuiltWith  sample  is  very  small:  there  are  only  18  packages  found  in  both  datasets.

Here's how each side is addressed and the key assumptions made:

1. **Supply-Side Value:**
   - The supply-side value is calculated by estimating the cost to recreate each OSS package. This is done using the COCOMO II model, which transforms lines of code into dollar values. The model considers the effort in person-month units and uses default parameter values for non-linear adjustment factors and effort-adjustment factors.
   - A key assumption here is that there are no production externalities, meaning there is no spillover knowledge from one package to another that would reduce programming costs. Each package is assumed to be reproduced by separate programmers with identical skill levels, without efficiency gains from learning.

2. **Demand-Side Value:**
   - The demand-side value incorporates usage information for each package. It calculates the cost for firms to replace OSS packages they use, considering them as club goods. The value reflects the cost to rewrite all widely-used OSS once and the cost for each firm to pay a developer to rewrite those packages.
   - The methodology assumes no consumption externalities, meaning there is no additional benefit to the general public from the creation of a package. Each firm is assumed to replace a package only once.

3. **Key Assumptions:**
   - The methodology assumes no production or consumption externalities.
   - It uses default parameter values in the COCOMO II model due to a lack of prior information for each project.
   - The global wage for programmers is calculated based on the base monthly salaries from the top 30 countries by GitHub developer counts, with bounds created using low-wage (India) and high-wage (USA) labor markets.
   - The approach underestimates the true value of recreating each package by excluding documentation and empty lines from the lines of code count.

Overall, the methodology provides a structured way to estimate the economic value of OSS by considering both the cost of recreating software and the value derived from its usage, while making several simplifying assumptions to address data constraints.",ai (gpt-4o),ai (gpt-4o)

When considering the demand (usage) side, we observe that the Census packages were used over 2.7 million times while 92% of this usage is attributable to the top languages. The average package was used 1,472.4 times with a higher usage of around 1,497.5 for the top  languages.

The  average  package  within  the  BuiltWith  sample  has  111 thousand  lines  of  code  with  a  lower  average  of  around  80  thousand  lines  of  code  for  the  top languages. This is because our BuiltWith data primarily consists of JavaScript-based packages, which are often smaller than packages written in other languages. BuiltWith packages were used over 142 thousand times where 99.97% were attributable to the top languages.

To reproduce all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the idea of OSS still exists, but all current OSS is deleted and needs to be coded from scratch), using programmers at the average developer wage from India, it would require an investment of $1.22 billion.

It is useful to compare these numbers to those from similar studies to understand differences in valuing all OSS (prior studies) versus that which is widely used (our study). Robbins et al. (2021) and Blind et al. (2021) use a method similar to ours and estimate that the value of OSS created in the US is $38 billion in 2019 and that created in the EU is €1 billion in 2018. Wachs et al.

All estimates in Table 2 are based only on software languages classified in bucket  1  from  Table  A1,  which  are  the  most  likely  to  be  written  by  a  human  rather  than  a machine. 19 The first column contains estimates with wages from a low income country (India), the global  average  wage,  and  a  high  income  country  (United  States  of  America),  respectively  (as described above). To reproduce all widely-used OSS once (e.g., the idea of OSS still exists, but all current OSS is deleted and needs to be coded from scratch), using programmers at the average developer wage from India, it would require an investment of $1.22 billion. In contrast, if we use the average developer wage from the United States, then reproducing all widely-used OSS would require  an  investment  of  $6.22  billion.  Using  a  pool  of  programmers  from  across  the  world, weighed based on the existing geographic contributions to OSS as discussed above, would lead to an investment somewhere in between the low and high-income country, $4.15 billion. It is useful to compare these numbers to those from similar studies to understand differences in valuing all OSS (prior studies) versus that which is widely used (our study). Robbins et al. (2021) and Blind et al. (2021) use a method similar to ours and estimate that the value of OSS created in the US is $38 billion in 2019 and that created in the EU is €1 billion in 2018. Wachs et al. (2022) show that roughly 50% of OSS contributions come from the US and EU combined. In aggregate, that would lead these studies to give a global value of OSS of $78 billion.']","The estimated investment required to reproduce all widely-used OSS using programmers at the average developer wage from India is $1.22 billion.

For firms (domains) that are associated with multiple industries we took the average value and distributed it across industries.\n\nIn this study we estimate the value of widely-used open source software globally with two unique datasets: the Census of OSS and the BuiltWith data. We are able to estimate not only the supply side value of existing code (e.g., the cost it would take to rewrite each piece of widely-used OSS once) but also the demand side value for the private economy (e.g., the cost it would take for each company that uses a piece of OSS to rewrite it). While we do not focus on the long tail of OSS, we consider this an additional contribution of our study as focusing on OSS that is widely used allows us to more precisely understand the value created by OSS, rather than only measuring the  replacement  cost  for  all  OSS  (which  would  overestimate  the  true  value  since  many  OSS projects are not used in production code). However, although we highlight the substantial value that OSS has in our society based on a wide swath of usage data, it is not feasible to identify 100% of  the  OSS  used  across  the  world  and,  as  such,  our  demand-side  estimates  are  likely  an underestimate of the true value.\n\nAdjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only. There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.

There is substantial heterogeneity in the value across programming languages and whether the code is inward-facing - i.e., for creating products that are being sold - or outward-facing - i.e., used on the company's website. The top 6 programming  languages  create  84%  of  the  demand-side  value.  We  also  show  substantial heterogeneity by industries and, finally, heterogeneity in the value contributions by programmers themselves.""]","The industry with the highest demand-side value for open source software (OSS) is 'Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services,' with a usage value of around $43 billion. This is higher compared to 'Retail Trade' and 'Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services,' which have usage values of $36 billion and $35 billion, respectively. In contrast, industries such as 'Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction,' 'Utilities,' and 'Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing, and Hunting' constitute a much smaller portion of the demand-side value, reflecting the lesser role of software in these classical non-service sector industries.",ai (gpt-4o),ai (gpt-4o)
36,"**Question:** How does the demand-side value of Open Source Software (OSS) vary across different programming languages and industries, and what percentage of this value is generated by a small group of programmers?","[""Adjusted for usage, we find a large demand-side value of OSS of $8.8 trillion when using programmers from across the world, with some variance, depending on whether we would hire programmers from a low- or high-income country only.

To value OSS via the goods market approach, we created a basket of equivalent substitute proprietary goods that are priced on the open market as a stand-in for an OSS product.  This  methodology  is  consistent  with  that  used  in  the  prior  literature  (Greenstein  and Nagle, 2014; Murciano-Goroff et al., 2021) although both of those studies only used a single good rather than a basket since they were focused on only one type of OSS (web servers). Since there is no readily available database for proprietary equivalents of OSS, we conduct a search based on subjective  perception  of  popularity  of  OSS  and  we  then  search  for  pecuniary,  closed-source substitutes for them. The resulting basket of 20 OSS packages with proprietary substitutes is a good representation of the diversity of OSS. The software ranges from media and design software to statistical analysis programs, to database management and web server software. 21\n\n21 Table A5 shows the basket of OSS and their proprietary equivalents that we used. To create this basket, we looked for proprietary software that had an OSS equivalent that was similar in its overall function and feature set, and sought to identify pairs of software that, in aggregate, captured a broad and representative set of the types of OSS that exist.\n\nBased on our OSS equivalent substitute proprietary goods basket we then obtain prices for each proprietary software equivalent and we calculated the COCOMO labor market supply-side value for each OSS product in the basket which we use as a proxy - for lack of the code from the proprietary software - for the COCOMO labor supply side value of the proprietary software (e.g., the cost it would take to pay a programmer to write that proprietary software from scratch). We then calculate the average COCOMO labor supply-side value of the basket, 𝑉 !,1#23.4 ,  and  the average price for the basket, 𝑃 !,1#23.4 . 22 Since, we know the labor market supply-side value of all OSS, 𝑉 ! ""#$%&amp; , we can setup the following equation and obtain the price of OSS, 𝑃 ! for the goodsmarket for all OSS via a simple scaling transformation:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nThis results in the following goods-market supply-side value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nWe can then obtain the equivalent demand-side goods-market values as follows:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nFrom the goods market side, we consider the equivalent price that a firm would charge if it produced all existing widely used OSS and then sold it as a product to customers.\n\nTable A6, column 3 shows that the value on the demand side ranges between $177 million and $244 million across the different buckets independent of the country of origin from which programmers are hired. Naturally, the goods-market value will be substantially smaller than the labor demand value since this imaginary firm will make a profit at a comparatively low price by producing the software once and then selling it to many customers. Further, while Greenstein and Nagle (2014) as well as Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) focus on one particular type of software only (web servers), we attempt to expand on their approach to many goods. However, the data limitations become a stronger constraint in this context which makes it inherently more difficult\n\n22 We obtained the average price of the goods-market proprietary basket by using a 3 years lifespan of software, i.e. 1/(1-0.66), so the depreciation factor is 0.33.']","The goods market approach estimates the value of open-source software (OSS) by creating a basket of equivalent proprietary software substitutes that are priced on the open market. This method involves identifying proprietary software that has similar functions and features to OSS and calculating the average price of this basket. The goods market approach assumes a fixed price for selling a good multiple times, which is typically lower than the total value estimated from recreating all packages on the labor side.

In contrast, the labor market supply-side value is estimated using the COCOMO model, which calculates the cost it would take to pay programmers to write the software from scratch. This method considers the labor required to reproduce the OSS packages.

The differential between these estimates arises because the goods market approach assumes that a firm steps in to reproduce the OSS packages and sells them at a pecuniary price, whereas the labor market approach considers the cost of all firms needing to reproduce those packages from scratch themselves.

""#$%&amp; , we can setup the following equation and obtain the price of OSS, 𝑃 ! for the goodsmarket for all OSS via a simple scaling transformation:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nThis results in the following goods-market supply-side value:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nWe can then obtain the equivalent demand-side goods-market values as follows:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nFrom the goods market side, we consider the equivalent price that a firm would charge if it produced all existing widely used OSS and then sold it as a product to customers.\n\nTable A6, column 3 shows that the value on the demand side ranges between $177 million and $244 million across the different buckets independent of the country of origin from which programmers are hired. Naturally, the goods-market value will be substantially smaller than the labor demand value since this imaginary firm will make a profit at a comparatively low price by producing the software once and then selling it to many customers. Further, while Greenstein and Nagle (2014) as well as Murciano-Goroff et al. (2021) focus on one particular type of software only (web servers), we attempt to expand on their approach to many goods. However, the data limitations become a stronger constraint in this context which makes it inherently more difficult\n\n22 We obtained the average price of the goods-market proprietary basket by using a 3 years lifespan of software, i.e. 1/(1-0.66), so the depreciation factor is 0.33.']","The goods market approach estimates the value of OSS by creating a basket of equivalent substitute proprietary goods that are priced on the open market as stand-ins for OSS products. This method assumes a hypothetical scenario where OSS does not exist and must be recreated by a single firm, which then sells it at a fixed price. The differential between the goods market approach and the labor market supply-side value arises because the goods market approach assumes a fixed price for selling a good multiple times, which is usually lower than the total value estimated from recreating all packages on the labor side. The labor market supply-side value considers the cost it would take to pay programmers to write the software from scratch, which is typically higher than the price a firm would charge for selling the software to multiple customers.",ai (gpt-4o),ai (gpt-4o)

1. **Data Limitations**: The approach is constrained by the lack of comprehensive data, making it difficult to accurately estimate the value of OSS.

2. **Assumptions Required**: This method requires numerous assumptions, such as the assumption that market demands for proprietary software and OSS are similar, which may not hold true.

3. **Pricing Sensitivity**: The pricing strategy of proprietary software is sensitive to market demand, which complicates the estimation process when extending the goods-market approach to multiple goods.

4. **Imputed Price Flaws**: The approach assumes that imputed prices for proprietary software are identical for each OSS product, which is an oversimplification and can lead to inaccurate estimates.

6. **Variance in Estimates**: The goods-market approach can create more variance in estimates compared to the labor-market approach.

Given these limitations, a labor-market approach might be preferred because it places stronger emphasis on the actual labor costs involved in developing OSS, potentially providing a more accurate and reliable estimate of its value.

It highlights the complexities and assumptions required due to data limitations, which make this approach inherently difficult. The goods-market approach involves estimating the value by considering the market demand and pricing strategies of proprietary software counterparts. However, this method can lead to substantial underestimates of OSS value due to its reliance on assumptions about market demand and pricing.

An alternative, simplified goods-market calculation is mentioned, which involves multiplying a reference good's price with its usage. This method results in a wide range of estimated values, from $0.2 to $16.5 trillion, depending on the price used. However, this approach is criticized for being flawed, as it assumes identical prices for each open-source product and compares fully functional software packages with smaller application libraries.

Due to these complexities and the inherent flaws in the goods-market approach, the authors place stronger emphasis on the labor cost approach for estimating OSS value, as highlighted in the main body of their work.
